   "description": "Amid the crisis of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and the request of Governor Pritzker to close bars and restaurants - Del Toro has started a gofundme page to help pay for our staff's well-being.  We initially put off any requests for help because our team understands that our whole community is going through hardships and some more than others.  But with the uncertainty of when we can open- some of our friends and customers have reached out to us wanting to help so we started our own Gofundme page.  It's very uplifting to see our great community extend their well wishes and prayers to our team and it's greatly appreciated.  Any donations and all funds will be distributed to our staff. This is for their bills- groceries and other essentials.  Thanks again for any help. God Bless.  Del Toro Mgmt.",

   "title": "COVID-19 Mutual Aid Fund for LGBTQI+ BIPOC Folks",
   "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the particular vulnerability of queer- transgender- non-binary and/or intersex Black- Indigenous folks and other LGBTQI+ people of color (QTIBIPOC folks). Due to our community disproportionately experiencing a lifelong arc of violence and discrimination- many of our community members are impoverished and housing unstable.  Many folks in our community are self-employed or in the service economy- and living with disabilities- chronic illnesses- and/or compromised immune systems.   Realizing a need for mutual aid for our communities at this time- and inspired by  Ijeoma Oluo's efforts to support her community of fellow artists in Seattle - Amita Swadhin launched this fund on March 14- 2020 and has since invited their trusted comrades Treva Ellison- Natalie Havlin- Carrie Hawks- Ren-yo Hwang- and Alisa Zipursky to help manage the financial records and design and manage the process of fund distribution.   None of the people managing this fund (and none of their household members) will receive monies from this fund.  We are prioritizing LGBTQI+- non-binary- gender fluid- and gender non-conforming people of color because we often have less ties to familial support networks- we have historically been simultaneously overlooked and surveilled by welfare state systems- our needs have been surplus to mainstream political formations- and we tend to work in the gig economy.  We recognize that the nation-state does not provide a safety net for so many people- and that the United States governments response to COVID-19 has only deepened pre-existing hierarchies that make people vulnerable to premature death. We hope for a world in which universal basic income- universal health care- and other functioning social systems exist. We know that what we are doing is an imperfect solution to a very large problem- but we are trying anyway.  We did not place geographic constraints on this campaign and thus have received requests from all over turtle island that far exceed the funds we have raised. As of 11:50am on March 16- there are 451 individual requests for financial support.  We talked with other mutual aid funds about how they decided to distribute the money they raised and decided that we wanted to absolutely avoid parsing through peoples narratives and deciding whose needs were more important than others. We agree with adrienne maree brown who quotes Lao Tzu (author of Tao Te Ching) in  Emergent Strategy : If you do not trust the people- they will become untrustworthy.  We are choosing to trust the people. We are not social workers and we refuse to replicate that position and dynamic. Most of the pool of people who have requested funds thus far are not employed full time- have a chronic illness or disability and before COVID-19 closures were already impoverished.  In our commitment to mutual aid- we have decided to support funding requests in the style of a  rolling jubilee . Here is how it will work:   THE SURVEY WHERE PEOPLE CAN APPLY FOR SUPPORT WILL CLOSE on Tuesday March 17th 2020 at 11:59PM PST    Click here to fill out the survey and apply for financial support.    For folks who request funds before 11:59pm (Pacific Standard Time) on Tuesday- March 17th 2020:  In Round 1- we will redistribute $100 to every person of color who is LGBTQI+- non-binary- gender fluid- and gender non-conforming who is self-employed or working in the service economy (even if they asked for less).  In Round 2- if there are more funds available after the first round- we will prioritize additional fund distribution to applicants who are (in no particular order):  Black Indigenous Sex Workers Disabled/Chronically Ill Transgender or non-binary Not enrolled in or employed full-time at well-resourced educational institutions Not eligible for paid sick leave through any organization On the cusp of losing housing (especially looking at cities/states that have not yet passed eviction moratoriums) Food insecure   We will move folks who live at the intersections of these identities or experiences to the front of the line.   Round 2 of funds will be distributed according to the following formula:  * Give every person who asked for $101-400 the full amount requested * Give every person who asked for $401+ 60% of the amount they requested- or $400- whichever is greater.  * Individual grants will be capped at $1500.  Funds will be distributed via Venmo- CashApp- and PayPal payments.  We would like to thank all of the wonderful folks who have responded immediately to our call for mutual aid.   We will continue to raise funds through mid-April.  We are also distributing a list of various local mutual aid funds and mutual aid processes to every person who applied- and we are sharing our applications with several mutual aid funds. For instance- we are sharing all applications from LGBTQI+ disabled people of color with the  Disability Justice Culture Club  so they can assist us in meeting those requests for support.  We also hope that you will join us in calling for rent and mortgage moratoriums- universal healthcare- free childcare and the abolition of the fear programming that tells us that we cannot collectively take care of one another and create a world in which we all live in abundance!",

   "description": "Everyone has been affected by COVID-19- but there's a group of people who have been devastated by the virus.  You likely don't think about them often- but they have a huge impact on you whether you realize it or not.  Your birthday celebration- Valentine's dinner- night out with friends- anniversary celebrations- and many of your favorite memories are dependant on these hard-working individuals.  The group I'm speaking of is restaurant servers.  They have a crucial role in some of the most special events every year.   They are almost always struggling- but with restaurants closing left and right- there may not have ever been a harder time to be in the industry than right now.  We're asking you to help hard-working people.  You can sacrifice a couple of lattes- or a fast food meal- and make a positive impact on the people who have a helping hand in most of our meaningful events.  Since restaurants are already closing- the need for funds is urgent.  After you donate- we will disburse your funds to industry workers who have registered to receive aid from this fund.  Funds will be given out evenly to each person who receives them.  So- please- donate now.  It would mean the world to us- and the workers who will receive your aid.   If you're a server looking for help- first visit this link to see full details :  registration details   All registerees will be required to prove their restaurant industry employment before receiving funds.",

   "title": "Afya Rekod- AI User Data Driven App to Curb Corona",
   "description": "We are a Kenyan health tech startup- Afya Rekod sprinting to launch our AI and Blockchain built consumer driven health data platform amidst the corona virus pandemic in support of global efforts to curb the disease by providing a portal for people across the world to store their health data in real time- with a special focus on Covid 19.  This advanced app built to help users store their own health data- access health information and connect to health service providers was set to launch end of July 2020. However- we are fast tracking to launch the platform 4 months ahead of its time to work and capture real time data that will hit map areas where the Corona pandemic is growing and how it is evolving by collecting user generated information from millions of users (affected and non affected) across multiple geographic locations to allow for sufficient analysis in support of global efforts to curb the disease.  Afya Rekod is built to be a market place for health service centered around an individual- where the user records their health information at their own pace and convenience so as to improve efficiency in medical diagnosis through valid real time data.  Africa and many developing countries across the world have limited doctors and access to health care services. Lack of patient data in real time makes the problem even more damaging to patients and health service providers across the continent. Over 65% of Africans live in rural communities that are not connected and are off grid in terms of health care service access. This is the problem we are trying to solve.  However- the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic has shown the world once again that centralised health management systems that rely on people walking into a health facility are not sufficient. The world also needs decentralised individual/patient driven systems that enable people to update their own records- anytime- anywhere- in any format.   One of the critical issues affecting the world during emergencies like this includes inefficiency that leads to untimely deaths- limited access to health care services and delayed responses among other things.  Afya Rekod comes at a crucial time when the world is experiencing one of the biggest pandemics of its generation where we need to monitor the evolution of the virus very closely to determine the changing nature of symptoms- provide for real time consultations to support patients and especially people in quarantine and isolation- and access to relevant and valid information about the disease from the population.  To support Afya Rekod in achieving its objective to launch during this sensitive time we have opened a GoFundMe account to mobilise funds. The money will be used to fund the technology finalisation and support the go to market roll out of the platform.  The growing digitisation of health care at a time when the world is required to isolate provides an unprecedented opportunity for the world to come together and unite in efforts.  Allow us to welcome you to JOIN US!",

   "description": "Quirks' Animal Roadshows needs help through the business loss caused by COVID -19.   Quirks' Animal Roadshows are a family run business that provides enriching education through providing fun and informative animals handling sessions to groups such as schools- nursing homes- parties- libraries and at public events. We have many animals including: Snakes- lizards- amphibians- tortoises- guinea pigs- chickens- tenrec and invertebrates. Find more info about us at  www.Quirks'AnimalRoadshows.co.uk  or through Facebook.  W e have started to have cancellations of bookings due to the threat of the Corona virus.  If the schools and public events are cancelled we will be faced with very little income coming in through our business- but we will still have to pay out the £36 A DAY that it costs us to look after the animals.  We are asking our friends- family and community to support us through this difficult time to help us to feed and maintain our animals. We do not want to have to be faced with making the decision to close our business. Closing the business would result in the animals being rehomed to already struggling rescue facilities or being euthanised in the event of those facilities being full. We love our animals as family members and we love seeing the joy and education they bring to our community.  If you donate to us- the funds will be used to pay for animal feed- electricity bill for keeping them warm and lighting- replacing UV and heating bulbs as needed- animal bedding- supplements and vet care etc.  £36 a day equates to approximately £1000 a month in running costs. We are hoping that this fundraiser will help us keep the animals happy and cared for through the next 3 months of uncertainty. This does not include the cost of our human family expenses.  We are very grateful for every single donation- no matter the size.  Thank you-  Luke- Kayleigh- Lily- Noah- Bluebell- Nehemiah and all of our wonderful animals- who are as yet- blissfully unaware of the Corona virus. xxx",

Due to this many outdoor centers are shutting the doors and clients wide and fair are looking after their own health- children and thinking how to work from home. Because of this from no fault of their own- hard working professionals in the outdoor industry are losing entire years earnings just as the season is about to start. This will and already has had big affects for those in the industry most of which are sole traders and currently there is no government help other than universal credit.  This campaign is created to try and put some money back in the pockets of those guys and girls who have currently receiving no support from elsewhere.  The guys and girls- who have kept you safe- shown you amazing places- taught you lifelong skills- inspired you- brought you closer to nature and given you and your family memories to last a lifetime. If you ever wanted to get these guys a coffee now is the time.  Once we have reach the goal all funds raised from this campaign will go directly to freelancers from the outdoor industry via an application process to make sure the right money goes into the right hands of those who work hard every day in the outdoors- many with family and mortgages.  For many years the outdoor communities has been brilliant at organizing themselves and rallying to all sorts of causes- we hope that you can do the same now.",

The peak time of contamination is expected to be in few days and last for the following weeks. Nevertheless hospitals are already at full capacity in need of extra beds- infrastructures and equipment. The entire Italian population is locked in their homes. All the shops- schools etc... are closed except for pharmacies and food stores. What is happening is unreal- it is like a war.  The total number of cases in Italy- the country hardest hit by the virus - after China - rose to over 20-000 with over 1-400 deaths (including healthy young people!) Italy needs our help more to provide the medical assistance to the thousand of people who are suffering.   I hope you can donate whatever you can  to help the Italian families and the health system which is collapsing. Italian are desperate to go back to their normal life- be safe- be free- open the borders and welcome all of you again in one of the most beautiful country in the world.   *The money will go to the Civil Protection Campania  (Protezione Civile Campania) who takes care of the emergency so to buy the necessary equipment for the hospitals such us:  - Masks - Fans - Non invasive ventilation devices - Hemodynamic monitoring - Monitor   GRAZIE on behalf of all the Italians (of all the ages)",

   "description": "We are raising money to bring food to people into the epicenter of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States while simultaneously helping farms who have been left without any market outlets and face insolvency and going out of business for good.   We will accomplish our goal by aggregating food from local farms and initiating an emergency service that will deliver produce boxes to peoples' neighborhoods and homes in the Puget Sound Region. Our initial focus will be the greater Seattle area and Whatcom County.   We are asking for your help because we seek to get this program going in the immediate future and we lack the necessary resources to implement and commence the effort alone. Our farm- too- is struggling just to make ends meet and we need this project just as much as other farms.   Our farm is has considerable experience aggregating food from local producers and bringing it to drop-off locations throughout the region- so we feel compelled to respond to our current crisis quickly- professionally- and without hesitation. In just a matter of days we have built a coalition of both consumers eager for this service and farmers eager to supply it.   Your donation will help us get this project up and running quickly- and will help farmers stay in business while simultaneously feeding at-risk populations.    Why the urgency?  We are seeking to commence as soon as possible because people have been ordered to hunker down- limit social interaction- and avoid groups of people. People are afraid to go the grocery stores. People are trying to practice social distancing- and are being asked by our governmental leaders to stay at home. But- everyone has to eat. At the same time- most local farmers currently have no outlets to sell their food because farmers markets have been cancelled and restaurants have been closed down except for take-out and delivery. So- our project will do two necessary things: 1) Bring food to those who need it most 2) Aggregate and deliver food from farmers who have no other outlets.   Donated funds will go toward staff time to get the project running- assembling the basic supplies needed to fulfill the project in a safe and professional manner- paying for the packing facility/cold-storage/vehicles needed to aggregate product- pack up orders- and deliver them- and also provide short-term loans to farms in dire need of money right now who can then can pay back the loan via produce that they grow and we deliver.  The response to this project has been overwhelming so far- and in addition to us delivering food to neighborhoods throughout the region- we are also engaging citizens in neighborhoods to \"\"pay it forward\"\" through community engagement. In this case- the community engagement is that site-hosts who receive food boxes for their neighborhood are also volunteering to accept food boxes and then take it from there by delivering food boxes to their neighbors who may be without transportation- sick- immunocompromised- elderly- and/or otherwise unable to leave their homes.",

This campaign answers their call for help. Please donate today to  #ProtectOurProtectors.   Your donation will be used to buy the masks- gowns- gloves and other protective medical supplies that are in very short supply but are critically needed by the brave health professionals working selflessly on our communities' behalf.   100% of the proceeds from this campaign will go to the Greater New York Hospital Foundation's COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund - which was specifically created to assist financially challenged New York hospitals for COVID-19-related purposes.   The Greater New York Hospital Foundation is the charitable arm of the  Greater New York Hospital Association  (GNYHA)- whose members include familiar institutions like New York Presbyterian- Mount Sinai and NYU Hospitals. But GNYHA also serves hospitals you may not be as familiar with such as the hospitals of the  NYC Health + Hospitals  system- which includes Bellevue- Elmhurst- Harlem- Jacobi- Kings County- Metropolitan and other hospitals that together make up the largest public hospital system in America- serving over a million New Yorkers every year. At these large city hospitals-  the need is particularly acute  as they serve large numbers of uninsured and under-insured patients. Because of the surge in demand for hospital care- they lack the financial resources and private donor network to acquire critical supplies and personnel.   You can help bridge this gap with your donation to this Fund. No amount is too small. Even $1 can purchase a mask that has the potential to save numerous lives.   Thank you for your support and please share this with your friends and help us #ProtectOurProtectors.       Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) is an association of hospitals throughout New York City and New York state that provides its members with health care advocacy and expertise. For a full list of the hospitals that are part of the GNYHA- please go to  www.gnyha.org/hospitals .  This Fund is operated under the auspices of Greater New York Hospital Foundation- Inc.

   "description": "Once upon a time I opened a bookstore...almost 3 years ago to the day. Since then we have been steadily growing- despite numerous setbacks with my Lyme diagnosis and flare-ups. Fast forward to 2020...the bookstore was doing better than ever with tons of promise with numerous events and opportunities on the schedule...all to come to a screeching halt with COVID-19. I'm swallowing a lot of pride posting this and asking for help... but I do need your help. I love Bradford. I love serving our community. I love my customers. I'm a firm believer that every town needs a bookstore and I'm scared of where On The Side Books will be on the other side of this shut down. The funds will be used towards the mortgage and bills on the building- so there will be something to go back to after this is all said and done. Every little bit helps...and if everyone pitched in a little bit- it would make a huge difference for On The Side Books. If you are unable to make a donation- all I ask is that you please share this so it might reach individuals who may be in the position to make a contribution.

   "description": "  Buongiorno Salentini (e non)-  vi scrive un salentino ormai trapiantato da tempo a Roma e barricato a casa come spero stiate facendo tutti voi.  Vorrei rivolgere un appello a tutto il mio network per uniniziativa che darebbe un contributo importante alla mia terra di origine: il Salento.  In questi giorni stiamo combattendo una guerra contro il peggior nemico che le persone della mia generazione e quella dei nostri genitori ha mai affrontato e al fine di sentirci partecipi e per una buona volta davvero patriottici- vi invito ad arruolarvi con un piccolo contributo.  Come vi sentireste se non aveste le gambe e aveste la necessit di essere portati in ospedale per una polmonite da COVID? Ecco- ora non pensate a voi- e pensate ai vostri genitori- o ancora peggio ai vostri nonni. Non potete certo accompagnarli voi- rimarreste contagiati e purtroppo che ci crediate o no- anche gli angeli del 118 avranno difficolt a farlo o forse saranno impossibilitati.  Cerco di riassumervi di seguito la situazione interventi COVID e DPI (Dispositivi di Protezione Individuale) in possesso del S.E.U.S 118 Lecce ad oggi:  · Soccorritori impegnati in interventi COVID per i quali si ha bisogno di DPI:  135 al giorno ;  · Tute EN14126 B4- B5- B6 necessarie:  135 al giorno ;  · Mascherine FFp3 necessarie:  135 al giorno ;  · Tute EN14126 B4- B5- B6 disponibili ad oggi 22/03/2020:  0 (Zero) ;  · Mascherine FFp3 disponibili ad oggi 22/03/2020:  0 (Zero) ;  · Tasso medio di crescita casi COVID in provincia di Lecce:  25% al giorno .  Inoltre- vengono forniti alla centrale 118 camici EN14126- a norma- ma che secondo i soccorritori non si avvicinano all'efficienza delle tute sopracitate.  Naturalmente gli angeli del 118 continuano e continueranno a soccorrerci- anche cercando di arrangiarsi- ma il rischio di contagio per loro è molto elevato e rischiamo di trovarci�senza gambe.  Vi riporto di seguito un virgolettato del  Direttore del 118 Maurizio Scardia  che ha fornito i dati che vi ho prima citato: Siamo circa 400 guerrieri in campo per combattere una lotta che vinceremo- ma con una corazza bianca ci riusciremo prima. Spesso una tuta fa la differenza !!!  Questo sar un gesto del tutto simbolico perché la somma che vi ho indicato- garantirebbe lautonomia solo per qualche giorno- quindi diamoci da fare anche perché un KIT DPI completo (mascherina + tuta) costa meno di 10 euro..meno di un biglietto allo stadio o al Blubay.  I fondi verranno indirizzati alla Onlus di Don Gianni Mattia \"\"Cuore e mani aperte verso chi soffre\"\" esclusivamente per l'acquisto di tute EN14126 B4- B5- B6 e mascherine FFp3.

   "description": "When we first opened  Aloha Nails  in 2018 @ Rea Farms- we were super excited at the opportunity to serve our beloved Mecklenburg county. As a start of any business- it was a struggle at first but with hard work- perseverance   passion- our business began to blossom and our Aloha Family grew. Everyday that we woke up to open  Aloha Nails Rea Farms - we were overflowed with gratitude- especially with the constant support of our beloved clients. For our dream is finally happening: a wonderful work place filled with dedicated staff and wonderful clients.  This dream came to a halt the past couple of weeks when COVID-19 began to make its sinister way into the US- then NC- then our beloved Mecklenburg county. We saw the increasing fear and anxiety in our staffs faces as people began to social distant and we could almost hear their thoughts: Am I going to be lay-off? and How am I going to pay my bills! Then it happened. Local- state   federal guideline of  social distancing  was officially issued to flatten the curve. With a heavy heart- we made a painful decision to  temporarily close  on Wednesday the 18th - March 31st (or even possibly longer!) to do our part for the sake of our staff and client's health. We pray that if everyone social distant NOW- we can all go back to our normal life SOON. As any business owner out there right now- we are terrified with income loss while still having countless overhead fees and rent to pay. However- even more devastating is our dear staff who are now without jobs and thus without income (esp tips) to support their family.  And so here is our plea: Please donate however much you can to help our Aloha staff.  100% of donation will go to them- after campaign fees.  For us- to see that they have clients and friends out there who care enough to donate   help them out during this crisis- is already a reward in itself. We can't wait for life to be back to normal again and to again serve our beloved Mecklenburg county.    Thank you  for your support always   Aloha!  much love-   Lesley   Codie  Instagram/facebook @ alohanailsreafarms www.alohanailsreafarms.com",

   "description": "Visit our website:  www.georgetowncovid19.com   We are a group of students from Georgetown University- and we are fundraising for medical supplies and devices to support hospitals in China to assist patients infected by or under the threat of COVID-19.   Why are we doing this fundraiser?  The SARS-CoV-2 virus (previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus) has permeated our news and conversations for the past month. Yet- no news can rightfully communicate the fear- confusion- and helplessness of those that are infected or quarantined- nor the courage and sacrifice of the doctors- nurses- and volunteers battling on the frontline. Many Georgetown students have families in China and Wuhan. They are worried and have contributed a lot of time and effort to help their families and others in China.   As students of Georgetown University- we are guided by the Jesuit tradition of Cura Personalis -- care for the whole person- and believe that it is part of our responsibility to help the members of the global community who are most severely affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic.   Therefore- we are holding this fundraiser to achieve two goals: 1. To provide funds that alleviate the immediate medical needs of Chinese hospitals on the frontline of fighting the coronavirus.  2. To empower members of the Georgetown community in making an impact on the fight against this global pandemic.    Where are the proceeds going?  The proceeds of this fundraiser will go to  Beijing Chunmiao Charity Foundation . We chose them because of their demonstrated quickness to respond- their proven ability to obtain medical supplies and devices to hospitals in need- and their emphasis on operational transparency.  Links to learn more:  Description of Chunmiao in English   About Chunmiao's coronavirus project  (can be translated using Chrome browser)  Chunmiao is a Chinese non-profit founded in 2010 specializing in public welfare projects in caring for congenitally-ill children- healthcare- education- elderly-nursing- and poverty alleviation.  On January 27- 2020- Chunmiao formed a Coronavirus workgroup that was able to raise roughly 40M RMB (roughly 6M USD)- more than 25M RMB of which is already spent to provide medical supplies and devices to hospitals in Wuhan and surrounding areas.  Chunmiao will decide the specific usage of our proceeds as they see fit (e.g. masks vs. ECMO machines) to the circumstances of the hospitals they support.    Fundraiser disclosure  Given that Chunmiao is non-profit registered in China only (meaning it cannot register itself on GoFundMe)- we will transfer the proceeds to a personal account first before wiring them to Chunmiao's account in China.  Stanley He - a current MBA student at Georgetown and the liaison between Chunmiao and us- will receive the proceeds and then wire them out.  We will be disclosing all financial transactions and records related to this fundraiser and obtain a receipt from Chunmiao. Chunmiao will also provide us a report on the usage of our donation to us. We are in the process of setting up a website to disclose this information.   Members and friends of the Georgetown community- we hope to get your support to come together and help fight this global pandemic by supporting the people who are fighting the coronavirus and saving lives on the frontline.",

In light of what we learn from China- Europe and North America- we fear that the coming weeks will bring hardship to our people.   The World Bank and IMF Senegalese staff gathered in the BFSSA Association are organizing a fundraising drive to support authorities- health personnel and people in these difficult times. Our goal is to raise a minimum amount of USD100-000 (about 60 million FCFA). We believe that we have a responsibility to serve our country by contributing strongly to this effort of national solidarity.   We therefore appeal to your strong mobilization and generosity to help limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Senegal.  About BFSSA TheBank-Fund Staff Senegalese Association (BFSSA) is an association composed of Senegalese staff working at the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund around the world.  The mission of the association is to support livelihoods in Senegal by funding development projects. Its members bring invaluable skills and experience in all sectors and offer a network of solidarity to promote Senegals development.",

   "description": "Dear United kingdom   Covid 19- is severe new virus - impacting the world.  This virus has potential to require hospitalization.  It will impact societies- countries- ecosystems.   This is a world health emergency.  - WHO(2020)  I am creating this fundraiser to target people's- best intentions- panic buying- and the UK's overwhelming reaction to Covid 19.  Health official warns UK to be on the same covid 19 projection.   This is clearly the biggest threat to the world since world war two and the cold war.  The currently presented mortality rate is different in alternate countries however- the infection rate is all the same (3x4x normal curent influenza)  Read about details and statistics off total Coronavirus here:   https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/    The societal impact of this virus besides it's symptoms- are crippling.  COUNTRIES EFFECTED TO DEVASTATING REPORTED PROPORTIONS:   Italy   Review picture of society in China after lockdown.   South Korea   IRAN   These are just the most current affected countries.  However  125  countries and one cruise ship has  Confirmed Covid 19 Cases. SEE STATISTICS:   The reason for this page.   It is to attempt to alleviate the NHS - in preparations for a national crisis.  THE NHS- already overwhelmed.  Recent survey demonstrating this. (Click these links)   However this new virus- could cripple the national health service as seen in Italy.   Italy warns:  European health services    Obviously this is alarming as- national mortality rate depends on- The healthcare services.  The healthcare systems need help during this inevitable global crisis.  NHS already attempting to stretch staff- from different disciplines- to cover the outbreak and crisis.     \"\"The worse health crisis off a generation \"\"  Boris Johnson (2020)   Ultimatley the best way to help society and not because you are selfish- but because you are selfless.  Is to donate to the NHS to cover costs of testing kits- staffing- PPE- treatments- quarintines and furthermore anything inbetween - relative to the coronavirus and the UK health system.  Obviously I've researched - shared and posted this information from various sources- so thanks internet.  However I set up this fundraiser to alleviate as much as society can offer- the national effects on the health care system.  This just feel like a more appropriate public respond to a national emergence- rather than panic buying non essential commodities.  Prepare your society for the pandemic not yourself.

   "description": "Dear family and friends-  Due to the COVID-19 epidemic- I was afforded the opportunity by my company to stay home and work remotely for the foreseeable future. However- I know there are many people that do not have this luxury. The economic impact that this epidemic has already created and will create reaches further than the stock market and my concern is what the long-term ripple effects will be to the small business owners of our nation.  Just this weekend I went to have a flat tire fixed at a locally owned National Tire and Battery- and at 3pm on a Saturday- I was their first customer of the day. Similar situations are inevitable- from your local gas station to your favorite restaurants- and I believe that it is our obligation as humans to come together and support each other in these times of need. That is why I have decided to create this GoFundMe for the entrepreneurs that are the backbone of our country and are not able to simply stay home to wait-out this epidemic. I ask that those who are fortunate to be in similar circumstances as myself to consider those that are not and to please donate to this cause. If the post generates enough donations this week- my plan is to choose a different small business owner each week for the fund and provide a short synopsis of what their business is and what the economic impact of this crisis means to their business. Also- if anyone knows of a small business owner who is impacted and would like them to be selected for the fund next week- please message me their information.  This weeks small business owners that need our support are Michael and Arthur. They are the owners of Five Pups Doggy Daycare   Boarding. I am fortunate to have my dog- Oakley- picked up in the morning and dropped off in the afternoon by them every day. They even go a step further to send me pictures of him throughout the day as he plays with the other dogs. In the past 2 days- their business has come to a halt- losing nearly their entire monthly revenue stream from boarding cancellations now that people are not travelling for business/pleasure and a significant drop in daily dog care now that people are working from home. I have personally not stopped Oakleys daily care with them because I know how happy he is to be in their care. Please help me in supporting Michael and Arthur- not only for them- but for all the dogs like mine that live much happier lives each day because of their business.  *100% of your donations will go to supporting Five Pups Doggy Daycare   Boarding*  Please also visit their site and use their services if applicable:  https://www.fivepups.com/",

   "title": "Lieve Oma Opgelicht Tijdens Corona-Drama",
   "description": "Wij zijn de dochter- zoon- schoondochter en schoonzoon van Els. Een lieve moeder (en oma van vijf kleinkinderen) van 63 jaar. Els heeft altijd een bewogen leven gehad. Ze is jarenlang leerkracht geweest op het basisonderwijs en daarvoor heeft ze altijd gewerkt met minder-validen en gehandicapten. Een vrouw die zich compleet inzette voor onze maatschappij en de minder-bedeelden. Los daarvan is ze voor ons de allerliefste moeder en oma die we ons kunnen wensen. Juist daarom willen we eenmalig jullie hulp vragen.    Els zit al een aantal jaar in de ziektewet. Ze heeft bijna elk mogelijke operatie gehad en overwonnen- en heeft tevens een vorm van kanker doorstaan. Momenteel staat ze wederom op een wachtlijst voor een buikoperatie omdat de vorige niet naar behoren is uitgevoerd. Door al deze lichamelijke klachten en bijkomende complicaties was het niet meer haalbaar om als leerkracht door te gaan. Echter bleef ze altijd positief en had een klein beetje gespaard om nog te voorzien in haar levensbehoefte en om leuke dingen te kunnen doen met haar (klein)kinderen. De moeder van Els (onze oma van 94) zit sinds twee jaar in een verzorgingstehuis. Na een val waarbij ze haar heup brak ging het snel achteruit met haar gezondheid. Sindsdien gaat Els elke dag op bezoek bij onze oma. Ongeacht hoe het met haar zelf gaat. Daar kwam deze week verandering in. Onze oma was erg aan het hoesten- en zoals het protocol luid werd ze dus voor de zekerheid in quarantaine gezet. Om vervolgens te kunnen testen op het Corona (COVID19) virus. Helaas is oma een beetje aan het dementeren. Ze zit nu in het verzorgingstehuis opgesloten in haar (kleine) kamer en wordt verzorgd en behandeld door de artsen in van die grote speciale medische pakken. Logisch en begrijpelijk- maar erg heftig en ingrijpend voor oma- en dus ook voor onze moeder. Oma kan geen bezoek meer ontvangen- en voor ons allemaal is dat opzich al een hele verdrietige situatie gezien de gezondheid van onze oma. Els is er heel erg emotioneel onder.  Afgelopen maandag kreeg Els de situatie van haar moeder te horen. De artsen vertelde ook over de gezondheid van haar moeder die enorm achteruit ging door de isolatie. Mogelijk zal oma dit niet overwinnen door alle onduidelijkheid en spanningen die erbij komen kijken. Ongeacht of ze wel of niet positief getest wordt op het virus. Maar nu komt eigenlijk pas het aller trieste van dit verhaal- waarbij we een beroep willen doen op jullie hulp omdat we simpelweg met onze handen in het haar zitten.  Els kreeg een WhatsApp'je met 'dit is mijn nieuwe nummer mam'. Gevuld met alle emoties nam ze het aan voor de waarheid. De persoon vroeg hoe het ging en of hij/zij langs kon komen. Een bezoek van dochter/zoon wordt natuurlijk altijd gewaardeerd- dus ging ze er goed goedgelovig in mee. Vervolgens werd er gevraagd of Els een paar betalingen kon doen- dan kreeg ze het geld contant terug. Els gaf aan dat ze dat geld eigenlijk niet had- maar wellicht tijdelijk haar spaargeld kon schuiven als ze het toch dezelfde avond nog terug kreeg. De oplichter speelde hier gretig op in. Binnen een uur maakte ze bijna 5500-- euro over- om vervolgens geen reactie meer te krijgen van het nummer. Pas na een uur ging er een lampje branden. Helaas. Ontzettend onhandig natuurlijk- maar de samenloop van omstandigheden maken dit zo zielig.  Els heeft haar complete spaargeld overgemaakt omdat ze zo'n lieve en goedgelovige vrouw is . Daar is op een hele smerige manier misbruik van gemaakt. Het feit dat ze bereid was om dit voor haar 'kind' te doen- laat al zien over wat voor mens dit verhaal gaat. De bank en politie willen (lees: kunnen) haar niet helpen omdat ze 'vrijwillig' het geld heeft overgemaakt. Bovendien gaan zulke oplichtingspraktijken schuil achter tal van anonimiteiten. Een enorme laffe daad van deze oplichter(s).  Mijn moeder gaf in het gesprek namelijk al aan dat het haar laatste geld was- en dat het niet goed ging. Dit maakt de pijn/schade misschien nog wel erger . Daarom willen we een beroep op jullie doen.  Onze moeder verdient het niet om zich momenteel zorgen te maken over haar spaargeld en leefomstandigheden. Ze moet alleen bezig zijn met haar eigen moeder- haar eigen gezondheid en de toekomst. Hoe onzeker die ook is. Ze kan niet gaan werken om het geld terug te verdienen waarvoor ze al die jaren al gewerkt heeft. Het enige wat wij wensen is dat onze moeder (en oma) zich nu kan concentreren op wat echt belangrijk is- en niet op haar oude dag- incl. alle omstandigheden- zich zorgen moet gaan maken over geld omdat iemand anders daar op slinkse wijze misbruik van heeft weten te maken.   Dus- al kunt u maar een euro missen. Wij waarderen elke donatie en hopen snel het geld bij elkaar te hebben- om onze moeder in ieder geval van deze extra stress te verlossen. Bedankt voor het lezen en uw eventuele donatie. Delen wordt enorm gewaardeerd.",

Sono la sorella di un medico rianimatore dell'Asl 2 del presidio di Pietra Ligure e per questo sento- ancora più forte- l'esigenza di fare qualcosa di concreto per sostenere l'ospedale in cui lavora. In questi giorni tutti i reparti di rianimazione d' Italia stanno dando il massimo per prepararsi ad accogliere- seguire e curare tutti i malati di covid-19 che hanno e avranno bisogno della terapia intensiva. Per aiutarli- oltre al supporto morale di tutti noi- servono presidi di protezione (mascherine- tute- guanti ecc) e di alcuni dispositivi utili alla respirazione dei pazienti.  Questa raccolta fondi serve a dare loro la possibilit di acquistare questo materiale nel più breve tempo possibile. Sono gi in contatto con alcuni fornitori che hanno disponibile quasi tutto il necessario- mancano solo i fondi immediati.  Ora tocca a noi. Anche una piccola donazione può fare la differenza.   I fondi raccolti saranno devoluti interamente all' Asl 2 Savonese per supportare il reparto di terapia intensiva dell'Ospedale Santa Corona di Pietra Ligure.

I was born in Chicago- I am currently based in Minneapolis and a proud duel-citizen of the USA and Argentina :) Guillermo Salvat- is my dance partner and colleague- and friend.   It is not easy to for us ask for help... But here I go.  The totality of our income comes from performing- teaching and coaching. As a result of the current COVID-19 crisis- all shows- events- workshops and private classes have been cancelled in its entirety. We had to interrupt our ongoing tour through the US and Canada of performances and workshops. Moreover- air travel tickets and accommodations are part of the investment of the tours (paid in advance and then recovered through the earnings of each event). This situation has dropped our income to ZERO- with no clarity or perspectives of future recovery. As Guillermo and I are unable to complete our work- we have lost most of that investment. Our work stability is not only compromised- but survival as well�I am looking for 5-000 to help NOW and over the next three months. Money will be spent in rent- food and basic expenses.  Now We are reaching out to the Tango community- Lovers of Dance- and the Arts- students and friends- to cover part of financial losses- and help me stay afloat through this difficult moment. All I want is to get back to doing what we love and every little bit helps us get there. We will obviously rebuild afterwards and be seeing you in your city- DANCING TANGO!  DONATE to help us ASAP due to COVID-19  Thank you in Advance for your generosity.  Miriam Lea  you can visit our website at www.salvat.lea.dance",

   "description": "My name is Alex and Im a 19-year-old business student from Germany. Due to the recent COVID-19 crisis- most of us are told to not leave the house and practice social distancing. In doing this- each and everyone has an own way of dealing with their days at home. Some might die of boredom while others try to sooth their anxious souls by feeding it with the latest news. To me- none of that makes sense. I cannot sit back and watch how another day goes by. Thus- I decided to start this fundraising campaign. Its in the interest of policy- economy and society- and therefore the concern of everyone- to put an end to the coronavirus pandemic. Although the development of vaccines to combat the virus is in full swing- it will still take at least a year before one is available on the market. In the race against time- coronavirus research is mainly financed by governments and non-profit foundations. In spite of this massive financial aid- more and more funds will be needed. Reliant on your participation- the goal of our fundraising campaign is it to collect 100-000 in order to support the development of a coronavirus vaccine. The full amount will be donated to  CEPI  (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations)- which is a global alliance financing and coordinating the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. If you want further information on who they are cooperating with and what achievments they already made in the past- you're welcome to take a quick look at www.cepi.net .  In light of large funds provided by governments and big nonprofits- theres no doubt that 100-000 is a relatively small amount and furthermore its also clear that we wont be able to accelerate the development of a vaccine.  This campaign is about something else : Avoiding social contacts- isolating ourselves at home and closing borders- it seems like the world loses social cohesion. It is Coronavirus that forces us to behave this way. But going through a hard time- its more important than ever to do the opposite and to stick together! Maybe we are physically separated- but if everyone just donates a few bucks- we can not only help finding a vaccine but also set a worldwide sign of unity!   Together we can fight Corona.   Alex",

   "description": "The COVID-19 outbreak is a historic public health crisis putting our communitys health at risk- especially the health of our seniors. AltaMed Health Services is a community health center providing care to more than 3000 seniors in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Our seniors cannot leave their homes to shop for food and essentials without risking exposure.  In an effort to keep our community healthy and fight this crisis- AltaMed is implementing community response measures to create and distribute essentials kits and food aid to frail- elderly seniors who cannot leave their houses. Most of those seniors are living by themselves and have no one to check on them.  At AltaMed- we support our patients beyond their medical needs- and thanks to our supporters- we have been able to start packaging and distributing a few of these essentials kits. Still- our resources are limited- and we have a sizable list of patients that are high-risk and will have a shortage of food very soon.  This fund will provide support to seniors who are impacted by the current health crisis. The severity of this pandemic is already palpable and is creating long-term needs especially for our most vulnerable community members.   Your generosity is bridging the gap between the needs of our patients and their ability to stay healthy during this crisis.   Thank you for keeping our community healthy and safe. Juntos podemos!",

   "description": "Healthcare workers are on the front lines of the COVID-19 Pandemic- and they are facing a massive shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).  Our small business-  Simple   Sentimental - typically creates personalized gifts- but we are stepping up and using our resources to create face shields for healthcare workers at  Vidant Medical Center  in Greenville- North Carolina. We are also sending donations to hospitals around the country- please continue reading to learn how you can send our face shields to your local hospital!  The primary hospital we are donating to- Vidant- serves 29 counties in Eastern North Carolina. They are asking for donations of face shields and other PPE to protect nurses- doctors- and other vital healthcare personnel working to take care of COVID-19 patients. Because Vidant serves so many counties- they are also a distributor to other hospitals and medical facilities. Any donations we take to Vidant are sent to the area with the most need.  We estimate our cost of creating a face shield is $8 per shield- so  for every $8 donation we receive- we are making and donating 1 face shield to  Vidant Medical Center.    If you donate more than $100- we can ship the face shields produced by your donation to the hospital of your choosing (must be in the continental United States).  If you donate $100 or more- we will message you via GoFundMe to see which hospital you would like them to be sent to. Please have their shipping address ready :) All other donations will be sent to Vidant Medical Center in Greenville.  We are able to produce up to 400 face shields per day- and we would love to fulfill Vidant's and Eastern NC's growing need of PPE. Below is a photo of what our face shields look like! We make them in our office in Greenville out of plastic.     I hope you will consider donating to our GoFundMe so we can support the people who are putting their health and even their lives on the line to save others!   Please reach out if you have any questions! We can also be reached on social media:  Instagram   Facebook",

   "description": "Hello- Pinoys abroad!   I'm Claudia Altavas and I'm raising funds for the frontliners of our hospitals in Metro Manila and other provinces of the country. I'm on quarantine in the comforts of my apartment in NYC and I feel like it's necessary to do something for our health workers while they sacrifice their lives on the frontlines. Im more worried for the Philippines and would love to help out in any way I can. Im sure a lot of the people who live away also feel the same and would like to help out but dont know how.  The majority of the cases are in the National Capital Region (NCR)- and test kits arent available in any other parts of the country. Theres not much we can do for now to acquire these test kits- so Im asking for your help in providing the frontliners the proper personal protective equipment (PPE) in handling COVID-19 cases.   Hospital frontliners:  doctors- nurses- med-techs- rad-techs- nursing aids- pharmacists- janitors- administrative assistants- security officers - anyone who is in close contact with COVID-19 positive patients and PUIs. If we can extend at least the masks to ALL hospital workers- why not?   PPE:  masks- goggles- gloves- face shields- shoe covers- protective suits- etc. These might require more improvisation and creativity as demand is high everywhere in the world.  I'm in coordination with two people who can help in mask- shoe cover- and protective suit production - a young designer named  Pia Alviola - who is currently creating PPE prototypes that will pass the health guidelines required by hospitals in treating COVID-19 patients- and  Jay Caluag - whose family owns a  patahian  in Bulacan. Both have already distributed masks for hospitals and health centers in Manila- and would like to extend distribution to other provincial hospitals that will need help.  Jonas Tamayo  -  another schoolmate from Ateneo- is also helping us secure face shields for our frontliners.  We just need funding!  We're also still looking for other PPE suppliers we could tap.  If you can direct us to any- let me know.   For distribution- we'll start with hospitals in Manila- Roxas City (Capiz)- and Dumaguete City (Negros Oriental). If we get more donations- we'll continue to help hospitals and health centers in other provinces.   METRO MANILA:   Philippine General Hospital Lung Center of the Philippines Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital    WESTERN   CENTRAL VISAYAS:   Saint Anthony Provincial Hospital Roxas Memorial Provincial Hospital  Siliman University Medical Center  Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital   We will add to the list as we receive more requests for help.  After allotting a portion of the funds for PPE production- we'll be sending monetary funds directly to these hospitals.  For other ways to send your donation aside from this gofundme page:  VENMO:  @tulongpinoy  (Please put a note \"\"#TULONGPINOY donation\"\" for documentation purposes)    Any amount would do.   Lets find ways to help. Shoot me an email (claudialtavas@gmail.com) if you have other ways youd like to donate- ideas- comments- suggestions- questions- and we'll figure it out.  International funds will be transferred via the XOOM app to suppliers and hospital focal points- which I will fully disclose in this link once we get this going:   http://tinyurl.com/tulongpinoyupdates    Rest assured- I'll be as transparent as possible on where exactly the funds go by providing the exact amount we've gotten after collection- and proper documentation and updates after we've released them to the respective beneficiaries.  Please share this initiative. Lets all help our country. Salamat po!",

   "description": "Hello-  I am making this fund as a contingency in the event that I contract COVID-19- which due to my job is a very high possibility. I work as a Data Coordinator in a very large hospital campus setting where I and my coworkers frequent nearly all of the clinical floors regularly. Like many of the doctors I work with- I have come to accept that I will become sick from this virus and will have to remain in isolation during recovery at some point in the near future. I don't quite make a doctor's salary however- so I am not able to leave work for any extended amount of time and still remain financially solvent. It would be comforting to know that I have a financial backup in this event so that I can continue to pay my bills and rent during a period of recovery from this virus. Thank you.",

Ci occupiamo di recintare i parchi per evitare assembramenti e facciamo parte del C.O.C. (Centro di Coordinamento Comunale) che insieme al comune e le forze dellordine- organizziamo quotidianamente le azioni da svolgere e teniamo monitorata lemergenza.  Le nostre squadre sono inoltre impegnate nelle attivit di supporto alle forze dellordine nella comunicazione diretta- infatti giriamo quotidianamente con i nostri mezzi per le vie della citt- trasmettendo comunicazioni alla cittadinanza di rimanere in casa e uscire solo per necessit primarie.  Allo scopo di continuare a questi ritmi la nostra attivit è fondamentale per noi avere dispositivi di protezione individuali per proteggere noi e le persone che andiamo ad aiutare- e la benzina per i nostri mezzi che girano continuamente in queste settimane.

Per questo abbiamo deciso di mettere a disposizione professionalit e contatti per raggiungere l'obiettivo prefisso:  acquisto di ventilatori a favore del reparto di rianimazione dell'ospedale Giovanni Paolo II di Olbia.

We have had so much support from the people of Ayrshire and beyond and we want to do our bit to give back a nice cup of hope and heartfelt thanks.  Although we would love to be in a position to donate these ourselves- as a small family business we simply could not afford this.  We are asking for donations and for every penny donated this will go to providing treats to those who deserve it most at this tough time.  Once donations are received- we will publish a post across social media asking for specific nominations for the gifts. This will likely include groups of NHS staff- charity workers and care home staff but could stretch to supermarket workers- transport workers or just anybody that is giving their all to support others.  As we are not sure how this will go- and also what stage we will be at come the start of next week- we will take an initial run of donations up until Sunday - if any lockdown was to occur for The Kart - This will naturally be honoured once open again.  Each £2 donation is enough to give to 1 unsung hero and any additional fuel and staff costs will be covered by The Espresso Kart.",

Sto vivendo la preoccupazione attraverso i suoi occhi e le sue parole. Passa la maggior parte della sua vita in ospedale- sono due settimane che non lo posso abbracciare e dorme in unaltra stanza della casa per tutelare la nostra salute.  E come lui- tutti i medici e gli infermieri lavorano in silenzio- senza sosta- senza riflettori- impegnati a dare il loro contributo per bloccare questo virus che non guarda in faccia nessuno.  Gli ospedali di provincia stanno combattendo una guerra al virus molto difficile- non godendo della visibilit e del sostegno che lItalia e il mondo stanno dando invece alle strutture più grandi.  Eppure anche qui- nei piccoli ospedali- ci sono vite da salvare. E salvare una vita è una cosa grande.    Non tutti hanno la possibilit e la capacit di lottare in prima in linea- ma tutti possono contribuire affinchè sempre più medici e infermieri siano messi nelle condizioni di poterlo fare.    Aiutiamo gli ospedali della provincia di Pavia a bloccare questo virus- prima che ci blocchi lui.   #BLOCCHIAMOLOINSIEME              In questo momento le attrezzature necessarie per affrontare al meglio il virus nella terapia intensiva e subintensiva sono:            Ventilatori          Dispositivi di ventilazione non invasiva          Monitoraggio emodinamico          Monitor          DPI           E tutto ciò che può essere necessario in questo momento negli interventi            Anche una piccola donazione può fare la differenza.

   "description": "As we all try and cope with COVID-19 (coronavirus)- there are a lot of people in New York City impacted by this new restaurant/ bar ban. Many of our neighbors are in difficult positions.    Over the past 10 years- I have worked alongside some of the greatest people in the restaurant and bar industry. Bartenders- barbacks- bussers- porters- DJs- servers- bottle service- delivery people- and much more.  Sadly a lot of them are undocumented or not even on the books at some of your favorite restaurants and bars. And it's often not by choice.  I am asking you to join me in supporting them. We want to help at least 5 businesses- and help as many people who work at these establishments. We are focusing on those who cannot get unemployment benefits because they have been off the books for three years or the bartender/ server that only gets paid in cash. Many of them are unable to work at home but still have rent and other bills to pay. This is a dire and stressful position to be in- and we shouldn't take this for granted.   As soon as we receive funds we will start highlighting   dispersing immediately. By donating as little as a dollar you can help pay someone's cellphone- the electric bill- or buy some groceries.  With the economic impacts of COVID-19 hitting New York City- it's only going to get more tough for a lot of people.  We may need to socially distance ourselves to flatten the curve of infection- but we also need to reach out and support our neighbors best we can. Luckily the internet makes that pretty easy. Donate now.  Let's come together like we all say we would in a time of crisis.

Groceries have come in at three times the cost and more of what we would normally spend because not in a position to shop sales or cheap and prices change by time they are delivered. And because of shortages and stockpiling by others we have been forced to order from multiple sources and thus pay multiple delivery charges. It would also be helpful at this time to order a humidifier and some additional towels and undergarments as laundry is less frequent. Thank you for any support you can provide.",

Now that we can no longer support them financially- we are asking for your help!  We ask that our generous BierWax community consider adding funds into a \"\"tip jar\"\" for our bartenders during this very challenging time. Many of you have asked how to support and this is a very important way to support the individuals who were so vital to our success over the past 2+ years. 100% of the funds raised will go to our most recent staff members. We will be making the first contribution to the Relief Fund and hope you can join us in supporting.   Thanks for your continued patronage and support!",

Due to preventative measures being taken to limit further spread of the virus- many people are facing financial pressure in accessing basic food and housing needs. Due to many low-income families facing temporary employment loss- they have very limited places they can turn to right now for financial support.  We are a group of student teachers who are raising money for families and elders who need assistance in affording groceries during this financially restricting time. It is in times like these that the power of community is needed most and we see opportunity to help those in need within the Fredericton area.   With the money raised- we will mail grocery store gift cards to families who have contacted us through email that need assistance. We are hoping to provide gift cards ranging from $20-$100 dependent on family size and received donations.  *We cannot guarantee every family a gift card. Our ability to provide money relies on how much money is received through donations*  How it works:   If you or someone you know is in need of assistance- we ask that you email this address with the following information:   fccsp2020@gmail.com  - Family size  - Mailing address   - Grocery stores that are accessible to you  If you have the financial stability during this time- please consider donating here to help people in the Fredericton community.

This includes small businesses that are not able to provide paid leave for their employees. Compliance to this recommendation is highly encouraged- but it doesnt protect the employees pay or provide any sort of financial relief. This leaves small business owners stuck in a very tough place.  Obsidian Nail Studio in the South Hills of Pittsburgh is owned by my sister- Stephanie Campbell. She and her three nail artists provide incredible services to their clients. Unfortunately- Obsidian Nail Studio will have to close from March 17th until March 31st- following the closure recommendation. This means that she and her nail artists wont be making any money for two entire weeks. Steph has a young daughter who will be turning nine years old during this two week closure. She and her stylists each have bills- rent- and mortgage payments. COVID-19 can close businesses- but it cant stop the bills from coming.  Id like to support my sister and her employees during this difficult time by raising money for them to cover their time of unemployment. All four of them together in two weeks make $12-000. Please add your support to help these beautiful ladies despite the unfortunate temporary closure of their salon and income. Thank you so much for sharing and donating!!

Dear all-  I am starting this fundraiser to help those financially impacted by the social distancing movement in MD. I am grateful that I am able to work from home and still get paid at my job- but it's made me realize that others are not so fortunate.   I have a few amazing friends that were immediately impacted. They and their teams need our help! They belong to the service industry- salon industry workers- and entertainment industry performers- PEOPLE WHO RELY ON TIPS.  I'm just doing this on my own. I really care about them. I'm not part of any organization. If you are nervous to donate because you don't know me- I guess you're just going to have to trust a stranger.  I am calling on the community and beyond to donate a tip. I don't have anything to give you in return- but hopefully we can come together in this time and help each other out.  HOW IT WORKS: Think about how much you tip for a coffee- a meal- a drink- a happy hour- a haircut- or a live band playing at a bar. You donate however much you want. It goes into a pot and is divided among applicants who have been immediately impacted. Once it's divided up- it might not be a lot for them- but it's something.  HOW TO DONATE: Donate through GoFundMe.  The campaign will run through Wednesday- April 1st to ensure that workers can get their tips ASAP.  Kind regards-  Belu Barriga",

Since we launched our Covid-19 Relief campaign two weeks ago- we have delivered 800kg of food   household goods to over 150 people in need- 88% of that in the last 5 days alone . We have been lucky enough to receive in-kind donations from all around Manchester including restaurants- pubs- other organisations and individuals. Surplus funds raised during our Nobody Hungry at Christmas campaign was used to start this relief campaign.  We are down to our last £200. This will potentially last two weeks. We are desperate to keep this service running throughout the COVID-19 crisis. We are in the process of registering as a CIO and are waiting to hear back from the relevant organisations; this unfortunately means that until we have our registered charity number- we have limited access to many funding opportunities. We hope to be registered by the summer- but until then- we are asking for your support.  We have a team of wonderful volunteers and are able to provide a next-working day turnaround to any service user who requests a food parcel. We have increased our service to include the following things:  -Food parcel service. This is by far the most popular option for many people. We are receiving referrals from trusted professionals now (though we always have been- and always will be based on trust alone). These are completely free to our clients and include basic essentials and any fresh produce we get donated that day.  -Shopping service or prescription collection. This service is for anyone who cant get out but requires specific items purchasing from the supermarket. We only ever charge for the items on the receipt.  -Dog walking service for anyone who cant get out  -Friendship check-in by phone.  WHAT WE USE THE MONEY ON  Primarily- buying food. The food parcels are the only service that we rely on donations for- but the last two weeks have shown its the most needed. Stock is limited in a lot of places so we are trying our best to work with supermarkets to keep our stocks up. We always make the money we have stretch as far as possible and shop around. We would also like to pay our volunteer expenses  many of them are driving for us daily and we would love to be able to reimburse them.  HOW CAN YOU HELP?  So what we are asking for is a pound. Nothing more. If all of our 800+ followers donated a pound- we would be able to keep going for the next two months. A £1 donation would mean so much to us and help us keep providing much needed essentials to the most vulnerable members of our communities across Greater Manchester.

   "description": "LDV Hospitality is a boutique hospitality group that creates restaurant and cocktail bar experiences inspired by La Dolce Vita- \"\"The Good Life-\"\" with our home base in New York City and 8 other cities globally such as Miami- Atlanta- Philadelphia- and London. Our teams of passionate hourly service staff bring the meaning of \"\"La Dolce Vita\"\" to our guests inside our restaurants and bars every day and in this very moment- they need the help of our community.   As COVID-19 has begun to greatly affect the hospitality industry- we at LDV Hospitality are looking to protect the well being of our employees.  We are focusing all of our efforts at the moment on trying to find ways to support our hourly service staff  among our LDV owned restaurants and bars being affected by lack of hours and regular wages.  While we work hard internally to find ways to continue to support our hundreds of hourly service staff- we are looking to the community to provide additional support to secure their livelihood while we are left with no choice but to close our establishments for the time being.  Support your passionate server- favorite bartender and dedicated cook today through this gofundme link- where 100% of the collected proceeds will be distributed to our hourly service staff to help cover their regular wages.   We do not know what is ahead of us and for how long this will last- and so we are incredibly grateful for this support.

   "description": "Bull Bay- ( 7 miles to 11 miles ) Jamaica is situated walking distance from Kingston- Jamaica. It is the site of the first COVID-19 positive test. A person who came from England to attend a funeral had the virus. This is sad indeed.   Jamaica now have 8 confirmed positive tests. The area is now under a 14 day quarantine with armed security forces restricting movements in and out of the community .   All schools are out for 2 weeks. Bull Bay is a very poor- disadvantaged community plagued by poverty and gun violence. Children and their families will be going without food during this critical time. In some cases there are no indoor plumbing- and families do not have access to clean running water to wash their hands.  I was born and raised in Bull Bay. I went to school there and it's dear to my heart. Some of the families who are there I went to school with. I know the need of the area. I have gone there to help in setting up and organizing medical missions- food distribution and back to school drives for children. I do this because this area has been neglected for decades- including when I was a child. I know how hard it is for these families and it will get harder still during this pandemic.  The police have a checkpoint in an out of the area so families cannot leave. It is important that we bring compassionate care to these families in crisis.  This fund will help provide breakfast- lunch- and dinner for children and their families. It will also provide assistance for medical care- soap- feminine hygiene products- bottled water- masks- disinfectants- wipes and medicine.",

   "description": "Love going out to eat- but can't find an open restaurant or tavern?  As a local food and travel writer- producer of restaurant events- promoter and supporter of local independent restaurants- and major eater-outer- I'm extremely concerned about restaurant staff- many of whom rely on tips and live paycheck to paycheck- who have been or will be laid off shortly.  This is because COVID-19 virus mitigation efforts on the part of North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper mandated the closure of all restaurant and bar inside dining statewide- allowing only \"\"to go\"\" orders and curbside and third party delivery.  Restaurant owners are incredibly upset about this because they often view staff as family.  A board of industry professionals and others will determine who benefits from this fund. Recipients will be vetted thoroughly prior to receiving any funds- after providing their name and where they had been employed.  Money raised will be used in a few ways to help these folks make it through to the reopening of their restaurants. One way will be Grocery Gift Cards. Anyone receiving benefit from this fund will be thoroughly vetted after providing their name and where they had been employed.  We are so grateful for any contribution you can make. It will have a far-reaching ripple effect- helping more people than you can imagine.  See More:  Henderson County Independent Restaurants on Facebook   Thank you- Laura Huff Carolina Epicurean- LLC",

   "description": "Avec l'augmentation du nombre des cas confirmés de COVID-19- le sentiment d'angoisse collective et de panique s'est installé au milieu des citoyens- provoquant une hausse importante de la demande en masques- bavettes et gels hydro-alcooliques- causant ainsi une pénurie due  la rupture de stock de ces produits au niveau des officines.  Le 1er mars- le gouvernement a interdit aux fabricants locaux de masques de protection l'exportation de leurs production- au mépris d'une demande nationale éventuelle. Le ministre délégué  lindustrie pharmaceutique a déclaré le 21 mars- lors de son passage  la télévision publique que l'Algérie dispose d'un stocks de 45 millions unités de masques de protection- dont une partie a été épuisée depuis le début de la pandémie en Algérie- le nombre atteindra les 50 millions d'unités avec l'importation de 15 millions d'unités et la production locale de 11 millions d'unités80.  Face  cette situation- plusieurs entreprises publiques et privées ont doublé leurs capacités de production en produits de désinfection afin répondre  la demande des entreprises de santé- des pharmacies et des citoyens.  Le 21 mars 2020- le chef de service de psychiatrie adulte  l'hôpital Frantz Fanon de Blida- wilaya la plus touchée par la pandémie du corona virus en Algérie- affirme que le personnel paramédical du service de réanimation de cet hôpital avait fait grève pendant sept heures pour protester contre le manque terrible des moyens de protection (bavettes- gants- gels- solutions hydroalcooliques et blouses jetables).  Nous sommes actuellement en contact avec des fournisseurs qui vont pouvoir produire les matériels nécessaires donc le don sera dirigé directement  eux. Par la suite- une personne du domaine de la santé sera en mesure de récupérer tous les matériels et faire la distribution dans les hôpitaux avec les cas les plus urgent. Nous avons beaucoup de contacts dans les réseaux de la santé en Algérie et en plus mes parents et plusieurs de ma famille en Algérie sont dans le domaine depuis 15 ans.  Svp faite un don!",

   "description": "thank you for your participation to help- deal with the recent corona virus :)   Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.  Coronaviruses are zoonotic- meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.  Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms- fever- cough- shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases- infection can cause pneumonia- severe acute respiratory syndrome- kidney failure and even death.  Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing- covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing- thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.    Let's pray for everything so that this virus can disappear quickly.  Thanks",

As his students- we are running this fundraising to contribute to his efforts and to appreciate his dedication to continue teaching us Capoeira- and pushing us to develop - especially now that we are asked to stay at home.  Mestre Pedro is living Capoeira. He has traveled the world to share his vision- passion and skills. Without the ability to teach classes these days- he is losing his income. So let's support our Mestre as he supports us!  Any contribution is voluntary and welcome. We acknowledge that some of us are hit hard regarding our own sources of income as movement teachers- performers- hospitality workers etc. This is all about us living solidarity - as one Capoeira family.

   "description": "Dear Fellow Community-  We- a collective of college students in Orangeburg County- are raging against COVID-19 by raising money for our community and organizations fighting to help families in need. We all know that many of our people do not come from households that have the financial means to remain afloat during these trying times. Many of us rely on secondary jobs- work-study- and/or housing and food plans on campus to help them throughout the year- however- since students have been forced to move out of their dorms for their own safety they have returned to homes that are not under the best circumstances. We also know that the many people in our Orangeburg community live paycheck to paycheck and it is a travesty that paid sick leave is not mandated by law in our State. This leaves our people struggling to make ends meet and we want to help them!   As an Orangeburg family- we must continue to look after our own and aide them whenever times get rough- and we are definitely in those times now. We will distribute the monies as follows:   - $1-250 (and/or 1/4 of proceeds) will be distributed to \"\"CASA Family Systems\"\" a private- not-for-profit organization whose primary focus is providing temporary emergency shelters- support- and advocacy to individuals and families affected by sexual assault- family violence- and/or child abuse and neglect.   https://www.casafamilysystems.com/    - $1-250 (and/or 1/4 of proceeds) will be distributed to the \"\"RAC Relief Fund\"\" an emergency safety net for struggling families in the Orangeburg Community that may need extra funds to help get toiletries and other essentials for their households during this lockdown due to COVID-19. These families will apply to the fund and the monies will be distributed based on need. Unfortunately- it is a possibility that not all families will be able to receive funds from this- so we are distributing monies on a first come first serve basis. Please click on the link to apply -    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-y1u6KVhmJ68AQ6-fMnyB1b5cSZ-7mhZ2wwdTzefKZM    - $2-500 (and/or 1/2 of proceeds) will be distributed to the \"\"Regional Medical Center (RMC)\"\" the primary hospital in Orangeburg- SC. We know that many hospitals are running low on supplies and essential materials to protect themselves and other people during this crisis. These funds will help aide them in getting these items needed to better protect themselves.   https://rmccares.org/    We are trying our best to continue to uplift our communities and do our part for families that need financial help through this lockdown of the nation and we need your support to do just that. We are asking that you give what you can so that we can really do some good for our fellow Americans! We hope that you can find it in your heart to help us help them.   These are truly trying times- but like anything- we will get through it as one family! Please stay safe and we thank you for your donation! Love to all!   Hail! Hail!  With Love- RAGE Against Corona (RAC)",

   "description": "Since the COVID-19 outbreak- We All Rise: African American Resource Center has continued to operate normal hours with precautions put in place to help protect both our staff and our clients. With the \"\"Safe-At-Home\"\" order- most service provider organizations have closed their doors- operating with a limited amount of services and support while staff work from home. Most shelters in the area have understandably put restrictions in place such as halting intakes for the foreseen future and implementing guidelines of when and under what circumstances clients can leave. We have seen an influx of community members presenting at our doors due to other service provider referrals as well as limited accessibility. Clients have new barriers they are experiencing each day due to the virus. These new barriers- along with the limited accessibility of receiving services from others- leaves us very few options in the current circumstances. This has meant paying fees and spending emergency funds we usually dont have to. Being a small and new nonprofit organization- we are very concerned about our limited funds being depleted due to this crisis. Our staff is committed to daily check in- with other agencies to keep up-to-date with how we can as a community holistically serve our clients during these hard times.  There are a number of issues that we are experiencing with both existing clients as well as all the new referrals. We have several men and women fleeing domestic violence; people currently living with kids in their car or currently in hotels without any next step options. With limited services from the DV shelters here in town we have stepped in to get these clients food- hotel vouchers- diapers- clothes- and other necessary essentials as they try to start to stabilize their life. Another common situation we have been experiencing is people who have been staying with friends or couch surfing are being kicked out of their arrangements because of quarantining and fear of the virus sneaking into the house or apartment. Our partnership with Transformation House has been essential as we navigate through this time. We have been able get several clients into housing there as they are one of the few shelters still accepting individuals- but we have also been providing emergency financial assistance for rent or security deposits so our clients have a chance to stabilize without fear of being kicked out.   Another startling issue that we have encountered is with ICS. When someone receives an ICS voucher- they then have to secure housing that will accept the voucher. Once this happens the individual pays security deposit and first months rent after that- ICS has to come out to do an inspection to ensure that the unit is up to code. ICS is currently not doing inspections; which means that no vouchers will be issued to pay rent for new clients. We have had several people present with no other options- most of them have already used relationships around them to help secure security deposit and first months rent. We have verified with ICS that at this time- there will be no inspections until further notice as well as clients will not be reimbursed for months covered while they are shut down. Most service providers agencies are not helping with emergency eviction notices- they focus on assisting with first month rent or security deposit. Our first step with these clients facing this very serious issues is to reach out to their landlord to see if there can be an agreement made due to the current situation- some landlords are unwilling or unable to make these arrangements. In this case we are faced with the decision to pay rent or let our client face an eviction. These are big checks that we havent had to pay ever before- as well as we dont know how long we will have to help.   Food and Essentials: We do our best to stock the office with snacks- nonperishable meals- as well as household/hygiene essentials as clients often need support to be sure they have what they need. We have been working closely with Pauls Pantry to ensure clients that are eligible can get the food that they need- as well as supporting our clients in going to pick up food in some DV situations to ensure the safety of our clients. We get calls daily asking for food- bread- and other essentials due to many situations from the virus. Some cant afford items- due to not working from closures of the virus; some cant find the items- due to others hoarding during this crisis; some have shared what they had with others in community and are now running out of what they have. Our first priority is to connect individuals with food programs in community- we have been in regular communication with Pauls Pantry- Boys and Girls Club- GBPAS meal programs- as well as a host of community churches that are offering assistance. Even while utilizing these other programs we cannot keep up with the demand of food of clients- especially with the amount of crisis clients we are seeing over the past week.   The virus is causing new barriers for our clients; we are also facing the obstacle of other agencies with closed doors or limited services so very few ways to currently collaborate to support our clients. With the climate- resources- and community changing day by day we continue to be as flexible as possible- but we also remain committed to our mission to holistically serve our clients. The list below is some of the immediate ways we would be using the funds to support our clients through this pandemic. As time continues to pass and the situation continues to adapt- we will be sure to clearly record how the money was spent.  -Emergency Housing Support: This will include rent assistance due to the current ICS situation. Money from this area will also be used to pay fees for living arrangements at Transformation House- so clients can get stabilized and start to work the program. This will also include hotel vouchers for those with no other housing options due to being displaced because of the virus as well as those that are fleeing violent situations that have no other options due to shelter closures other than to be put in hotels.  -Food and Essentials: We will be able to keep our offices supplied with food and basic essentials so when clients come in while in crisis we will have supplies to help them in the moment- so we can plug them into more long-term community resources. This will not only include food- this will also include items like deodorant- hand soap- shampoo- conditioner- toothbrush- toothpaste and other needed necessities. This will also include in situations of DV- where we would normally work with St Vincent De Paul or Goodwill or other nonprofits- who are now closed due to the virus- be able to get victims who are fleeing situation clothes as many of them just have the clothes on them and their childrens back. Lastly- since most clients are home not working- we have received a lot of calls to assist with copays for essential medication.  -Transportation: Due to the buses not running at full capacity- we have had to work with clients to find other means of transportation to and from work. In some cases- this means pairing clients up with volunteers that will help with rides and being able to assist our volunteers with gas cards. In other cases- this has meant working with Whatsoever You Do- Spokes of Hope program to get clients a bike- purchasing a bike lock to ensure the bike is safe during work hours. Lastly- this would also include Uber or Lyft rides in some of our DV/SA/IPV/Crime Victim cases.  We have applied for emergency fund assistance- but there is a turn around time with those dollars. Being a new nonprofit organization we are very concerned about our funds and supplies being depleted.   View our website by clicking here. ",

   "description": "This is a scary- challenging- and unprecedented time globally. We support the notion that all take part in a civic duty to #flattenthecurve- and want to help to prevent the spread of COVID-19- which could be fatal to our elderly- disabled- and medically-compromised citizens. That being said- those working in the performing arts community are feeling a direct financial impact from the sudden loss of work- with no sick or paid leave privileges for freelance artists.  While artists are adept at a lifestyle of financial instability- these unique circumstances are challenging because of the 1) duration of the lay off- 2) immediacy and 3) uncertainty behind when income will return.  Ring of Keys is a community of queer women- transgender- and gender non-conforming artists working in the field of musical theatre. We have a membership of 350 members in over 40 cities throughout the USA- as well as members in Toronto and London.   The Ring of Keys Member Relief Fund is aimed to help those Members in our community whose livelihoods are being directly affected by sudden loss of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   As the Executive Director of Ring of Keys- I can attest that these circumstances are detrimental to an already vulnerable and marginalized population. Some examples our Members are currently experiencing:  - Unemployment due to the vast majority of theatres and shows suspended or cancelled.  - No paid sick leave or paid leave.  - Ineligible for state unemployment insurance.  - Interviews for potential jobs cancelled.  - Major conferences cancelled- as well as jobs associated with conferences- and an inability to get refunds for travel.  - Fear of not being able to pay for life-saving medicine.  -Inability to pay basic expenses of rent and student loans  - Side jobs in retail- the service industry- or nannying also suspended.  - Instability and loss of creative dream projects taking an emotional toll on members mental health.  - Needing to dip into savings intended for other expenses (medicine- top surgery- dream projects- student loans- etc)   The amount we can provide is based on donations received- the amount of requests we have- and the requests we project will come in the near future. So the more you can help- the more funds we can redistribute!! Thank you for your generosity - we can't wait to get back to making art together - feeling together- breathing together- and sharing our humanity together!

Che cos'è un Coronavirus?I  Coronavirus sono una vasta famiglia di virus noti per causare malattie che vanno dal comune raffreddore a malattie più gravi come la Sindrome respiratoria mediorientale (MERS) e la Sindrome respiratoria acuta grave (SARS).  Il virus che causa l'attuale epidemia di coronavirus è stato chiamato \"\"Sindrome respiratoria acuta grave coronavirus 2\"\" (SARS-CoV-2).Lo ha comunicato l'International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses(ICTV)che si occupa della designazione e della denominazione dei virus (ovvero specie- genere- famiglia- ecc.). A indicare il nome ungruppo di espertiappositamente incaricati di studiare il nuovo ceppo di coronavirus. Secondo questo pool di scienziati il nuovo coronavirus è fratello di quello che ha provocato la Sars (SARS-CoVs)- da qui il nome scelto di SARS-CoV-2.  La malattia provocata dal nuovo Coronavirus ha un nome:COVID-19(dove \"\"CO\"\" sta per corona- \"\"VI\"\" per virus- \"\"D\"\" per disease e \"\"19\"\" indica l'anno in cui si è manifestata).Lo ha annunciato- l11 febbraio 2020- nel briefing con la stampa durante una pausa del Forum straordinario dedicato al virus- il Direttore generale dellOmsTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  I sintomi più comuni di sono febbre- stanchezza e tosse secca.Alcuni pazienti possono presentare indolenzimento e dolori muscolari- congestione nasale- naso che cola- mal di gola o diarrea.Questi sintomi sono generalmente lievi e iniziano gradualmente. Nei casi più gravi- l'infezione può causare polmonite- sindrome respiratoria acuta grave- insufficienza renale e persino la morte.  Alcune persone si infettano ma non sviluppano alcun sintomo. Generalmente i sintomi sono lievi- soprattutto nei bambini e nei giovani adulti- e a inizio lento. Circa 1 su 5 persone con COVID-19 si ammala gravemente e presenta difficolt respiratorie.  Il nuovo Coronavirus è un virus respiratorio che si diffonde principalmente attraverso il contatto stretto con una persona malata. La via primaria sono le goccioline del respiro delle persone infette ad esempio tramite:  la saliva- tossendo e starnutendo contatti diretti personali le mani- ad esempio toccando con le mani contaminate (non ancora lavate) bocca- naso o occhi In casi rari il contagio può avvenire attraverso contaminazione fecale.  Ad Augusta mancano le cose primarie. Mascherine e igienizzante. Aiutiamo la popolazione in questo brutto periodo!",

   "description": "COVID-19 has caused a rampant economic shift nationwide. Businesses everywhere are feeling the effects- and especially small businesses. Avenue Coffee has been the home for many over the last six years. It has donated to numerous charities such as Dorothy Day House- Memphis Crisis Center- Memphis Rocks- and more. We hope to continue making a difference in this city- and to provide a safe place where conversation is encouraged and supported.   I've been the general manager of Avenue for over a year now. Day one I started with our bank account in the red- almost ten thousand dollars in debt- and payroll checks which I had to put in my wallet for a few days before I deposited. Through that year we as a team worked hard and slashed that debt in half- began working on the interior of the building- and dedicated ourselves to making Avenue Coffee a successful business.   Much of this I believe is a tribute to the wonderful people I work with every day. They sacrifice more than any employees I know- holding checks if they need to- willing to take less pay even though they deserved more- and doing it with genuine joy and contentment.   But amidst this growing national crisis I feel it best to reach out to the community Avenue has inspired. Avenue has been giving back to Memphis for almost six years- and not just to charities but also to individuals. I've seen college students grow from freshmen to graduated seniors- spending four years in a space they call- \"\"home\"\". I've seen it guide conversations on religion and politics- which otherwise could be tense and controversial- with kindness and care for both parties.   In these times I want to ask you to consider supporting Avenue Coffee. We want to offer back much more to Memphis in the future. We have plans to redo the patio outside- to get t-shirts and stickers- to invest in more roasting equipment to provide more specialty coffee- and most importantly- to put us in a position where the giving to local charities in Memphis is not a financial worry but a gift given easily and without fear.  We are hoping that this virus subsides quickly and that much of what we raise can go to improving our shop but we know that much of this current season is unknown and I want to be honest and say that without this aid- I can't see us continuing much longer. We have had several regulars ask about our status during this time and it means so much to me that Avenue has meant so much to so many people.   If you choose to give- any gift is meaningful regardless of size. Just having your support is what matters to us. At this time- we hope to still offer coffee and a place to study- and will continue to do so until otherwise informed. Thank you for these wonderful six years- and we hope to be around for the next six.",

In all of the communities where we own real estate- schools have been closed for the foreseeable future putting meal distribution programs to children at risk. Local government and school districts are working with organizations to provide food and set up distance learning- but this is a huge undertaking as hundreds of families struggle with the immediate impacts including loss of jobs- food security- and child care and schools. As community partners- we want to support the ongoing efforts to provide for our residents while long term plans are made and put into action.  The Aulder/ZPM Social Impact Committee and our employees on-site have been able to provide  $2-800 worth of food   to supplement the lost breakfast and lunches and   $700 worth of activity books and crayons   to keep the kids busy while learning plans are drawn up .   Many residents have accepted the gifts with tears in their eyes- one such resident said-   \"\" Thanks to the employees- I did not have to search for lunch for the great grand kids today. Thank you- thank you\"\"  . We hope to continue supporting our residents and do everything in our power to mitigate the impact which this pandemic is having on the health and wellness of our communities.   But now- we are reaching out for your help to allow us to continue providing for our residents while the long term plans are implemented and especially ensuring the most vulnerable during this time (children and elderly) are being supported.   Please see below for a detailed description of how we plan on using the funds:   1) Distribution of healthy food to residents (including snacks- breakfast and lunch)   Specific food delivery and pick up times will be announced on a weekly basis- and all food will be distributed in a responsible manner.   2) Elderly resident check in / resource support   We plan on calling each of our elderly residents and asking them if they need any assistance or have specific goods or services which they need. Our onsite team will use resources available to provide the proper support.  If you are interested in volunteering to call residents- please fill out this interest form:  Link to Volunteer     3) Educational activities to be distributed to children (activity books- reading books- brain games- arts and crafts materials- etc.).   Many of our communitys children have little to do on a day to day basis - our goal is to provide them with educational activities which they can enjoy during this time of social distancing.   4) Supplement Technology / E Learning   The majority of schools have moved to an E - Learning platform but many of our residents do not have access to computers or tablets to participate. We hope to support these students with access to computers- tablets- and wifi to continue their studies in their homes.  More than half of American jobs are at risk- with limited income and the risk of food shortage- we want to assure we are doing everything we can to make a difference in our residents lives.   Every donation will be greatly appreciated.    Sincerely-  Michael Zito",

Due to COVID-19- we have closed our doors temporarily for an indefinite amount of time for both our guest's and staff's safety. However- due to these unfortunate circumstances we are holding onto a thread to survive. We rely on our weekly events to support our staff as well as our facility costs. Winter slow months followed by the COVID-19 pandemic have put us in a bad situation and even the smallest contribution would help us.  Your kindness is appreciated and will be celebrated later this year with a THANK YOU party.  All donations will go to our staff's lost wages and our facility costs during this closure. It will also help us prepare for the unexpected and get through this.  Thank you for your support during this unfortunate time. Stay safe friends!  3",

   "description": "About the Organizers:  Hagen Zheng is a high school student at Newton South High School. As the COVID-19 epidemic increases its hold on the world- there have been multiple social consequences that have taken place as a result. He believes that the world needs to come together so that it can fight off this adversary. Recently however- the many hateful actions of violence and discrimination against the Asian American community have created a social divide in society. He is disheartened seeing the overwhelming number of such stories and knows how much fear is being stoked by these incidents. In response- he believes that being part of the solution is the best way to quash irrational beliefs and motives.  Yankun (Andy) Zhang is a high school student attending Newton South High School and the founder of the Kids and Knowledge Learning Society (KNKLS). There have been rumored cases in Newton and school has been completely canceled. Recently- at the local drug store- he noticed that all the employees had different masks- meaning that they were bringing masks from their OWN supply so that they can continue to work. He also noticed many people out without masks at all. He worries for those people and believes that along with professionals- the average people should also receive masks. _______________________________________________________________________________________________   We understand that there are many GoFundMe campaigns for donating masks to hospitals- however- we have connections to factories in China that produce high quality- CE certified- and FDA registered protective gear. If we get more support- we would also use some of the surplus funds to donate masks to essential personnel who are not as well supported. This includes people who work in grocery stores- food pantries- and other food providers.   Below are the valuations for the different supplies and pictures of the products and the certificates:    $1000 + Shipping fee -  500 Goggles           $1000 + Shipping Fee -  60 Protective Gowns          $1000 + Shipping Fee -  500 KN95 masks             $1000 + Shipping Fee -  3200 regular masks",

Healthcare professionals are making their own masks- if they get sick- we do not have a second line of defense against this virus.  Long story short. This is a coordinated effort of 100s of people across Alameda   Contra Costa County- and beyond to organize- seamstresses and sewers- and to provide them resources to make masks at home. These masks are being built as per specifications received from John Muir- Kaiser- and various county hospitals. First batch of masks has already been delivered. We need to scale up and make hundreds of masks to tide over next few weeks- till the critical supply is restored. We have 20 seamstresses working tirelessly making masks.  Our team has been asked to create about 1500 masks this week. Masks specifications - size- material etc are provided by the hospitals. We need $6000 to buy cloth- linings- elastic- and other material to make masks. We have an external auditor to ensure funds are handled properly. Any remaining funds will be used for COVID-19 related support activities.  We owe it to our doctors- nurses and various other healthcare workers. They have families too yet they are not sitting at home but risking their lives fighting for us- lets do our part!  Thank you!

We are raising money in support of food banks in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) who are preparing to feed people whose jobs have been affected by COVID-19.   While many people have rushed to stores to stock up on food and other goods to prepare for any emergency that may occur- but there are some that are not as fortunate. Many people are not able to go to work or take time off with paid leave during this COVID-19 pandemic - for these people- their only option is the food bank. Every dollar makes a difference for these people. Thanks in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to us.

   "description": "We are all becoming affected by Covid-19. This is a story of a Registered Nurse- Autumn- who is working tirelessly on the front line during this human tragedy. Autumn is working the Emergency Department in an area hospital located in Baltimore City- Maryland. She is being cross trained to help Covid-19 patients.   Autumn has been a single mother to her son since I met her 11 years ago when we were baristas at Starbucks. I have watched her make it through school- excel in her career- and become a passionate and skilled Registered Nurse. She has always wanted to help people; it is her calling.  She's working long shifts and is being exposed every day. The hospital is low on protective gear. Autumn's family is terrified that she will be exposed to Covid-19. She has said- \"\"This is what I am doing it all for- this is exactly what I've signed up for\"\".  Autumn has always been front and center for anyone who has needed her. Even when I was sick- and had two surgeries- she took the time to bring me a care package and spend some time with me. This only scratches the surface of what a completely selfless being she is.   Autumn is conflicted because she does not want to expose her son and mother- who live with her- to Covid-19. She is considering finding a place at the hospital to hunker down and stay away from home. She stated she may be able to find a cot- chair- etc. Many of her coworkers are arranging to be separated from family to reduce the risk of infecting others. I am asking for anyone that can help- to please consider donating funds so Autumn can stay in a nearby hotel to limit the chance of spreading Covid-19 to her family. Additionally- a Nurse working the front line truly deserves to be comfortable- without risking her loved one's health.  As I stated before- she is a single mother raising her son. There is no other parent in the picture to help her. She pays her bills and doesn't take handouts. Funds are limited for her and she simply cannot afford a hotel to separate herself from her household. Autumn is on the frontline with some of the Bravest people trying to help others in this unprecedented health emergency for the modern world.  These funds would go directly to Autumn and if the full amount is raised- it should afford her 13 to 15 days in a decent hotel in our area. Please help if you can.",

   "description": "In 2017- my family and I reopened Pinewood Kennels in Breckenridge- MN. Our dream was to have a family friendly hobby farm and kennel business. We allow community members and groups to visit the kennel and farm- including summer school and youth groups. The past two years have been extremely successful! The kennel has been busy and people love bringing their young kids to visit with the animals!We have also rescued and successfully rehomed several dogs....we even kept a few rescue animals ourselves.   COVID-19 has hit us hard- as the majority of our business was kenneling dogs while people are at work or vacation. We went from housing 20+ dogs every day to one or two.  Being located in a small community- we strive to be affordable and flexible for our customers. The majority of our profits have gone to major improvements in the buildings- such a new heating/cooling to keep the dogs more comfortable and increase air circulation.  We are not looking to make money off this campaign- but rather to stay afloat during this uncertain time. The cost of maintenance and heating the kennel alone is around $1-000/month. The funds raised will be used to maintain the kennel buildings while our income has slowed down- excess funds will be put back into the kennel for more improvements.  Our family would be very grateful for any donation- no matter how small. We want to keep our dream alive and still be in business after this pandemic is over.  Go fund me and Intuit have started a #SmallBusinessRelief initiative to match donations for businesses that raise at least $500. Thank you to everyone that got us there!",

By and large- I feel most of us on staff would say that seeing our regulars is nine tenths of why we show up for our shifts day in and day out.   But as we're pulled deeper into the grasp of COVID-19- our end of the service industry is being hit harder than most. On March 18th the decision was made to shut down the bar in the interest of public health- leaving many of us without a means of income. This Go Fund Me is meant to address that need; to help members of the staff who could use any amount of financial assistance.  We will continue to be open for to-go orders from our deli if you wish to pick up sandwiches while grocery/beer shopping.

   "description": "( CLICK HERE TO VISIT SAMARITAN'S LAUNCH PAGE! )  This is me and my 88 y.o. grandparents who emigrated from the Soviet Union so my family could live insurmountably better lives. My grandma was the one who taught me to see the good in everything and the kindness in peoples' hearts. My grandpa was the one who taught me to use my imagination and build things for my neighbors to relish. Needless to say-  I love them to death . And with the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic and the American government's incredibly slow response system- for my babushka and dedushka-  I am now scared to death .      What is Samaritan?   I was calling my grandparents one day- urging them to wash their hands whenever they came home from running errands- when I thought of  Samaritan . I knew there are millions of people in need who don't have caretakers or loved ones to readily provide them with necessities- and with this came the idea for an app that  connects those in need with samaritans willing to help .  Samaritan will be a completely free- ad-less platform for those in need- or Receivers- to be aided by samaritans in their areas. The latter will bring food- packages- and other supplies to those who are quarantined- out of the goodness of their hearts.      What about Evil People?   In other words- what will happen if people misuse the platform to acquire goods and services? I completely acknowledge the security risks that come with this completely free platform- and am implementing the following to mitigate misuse:  - Samaritan and Receiver  rating system  - Login through  verified accounts  (Facebook and Google) -  (Future)   Background checks  with Passport Photos/Driver's Licences  That being said- there will still be numerous ways for people to use the platform for the wrong reasons. I implore early users to  flag suspicious accounts  and to  call Receivers on the phone prior to exchanges  to ensure the safety of both parties.   How to deal with community spread through this app?   Samaritans will be  onboarded with procedures on avoiding direct contact  with Receivers- as well as  best practices  for navigating the streets during times of quarantine. Extra security measures will also be put in place to  ensure the COVID-19-negative-status of  Samaritans. Of course- the app and its creators  will not be liable for accidental spread - but we urge users to use this platform for the greater good.   What if this flops?   If there really is no kindness left in the world amidst this pandemic- I pledge to  donate all remaining funds  from this GoFundMe campaign to the  American Red Cross .",

As we stay at home to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus- many returning citizens are in need of assistance. Whether its lost wages- delayed or limited healthcare access- or sudden demands for childcare and homeschooling- the returning citizen community needs our help.  Many reentry organizations are taking precautions and operating at a reduced capacity- therefore resources are more limited at this time. Online community meetings have addressed new and exacerbated challenges faced by returning citizens during this pandemic. Accessing and affording basic necessities under Governor Whitmers stay-at-home order- is not feasible for everyone. Its so important that we stay safe and look out for public health right now- but the financial burdens for returning citizens are real.   100% of these funds will go to returning citizens across the state of Michigan who have lost income and/or are seeing increased living costs due to work and school stoppage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is emergency funding to help formerly incarcerated people in need with their rent- food- utilities- and medical needs. The amount given to each person is determined based on how much we raise- how much clients have lost- and how many people apply.  We will send funds to the recipients mailing address or via online payment. If you are a returning citizen in need of funds-  Click Here to apply for support.  Thank you for your support.",

Funds donated to this campaign will go directly to Habibi's Salon and will be used to cover fixed expenses during the shutdown. These expenses include rent- utilities- water- insurance- and other expenses that we need to keep paying.  We are so grateful to you for considering a donation to this fund during these challenging times. Everything you donate directly helps us keep the salon open and lets us continue to be a part of the Willows community after the Covid-19 pandemic has passed. #SmallBusinessRelief  Thank you!

   "description": "Hi all-   For those that know me- I know you dont hear from me much. I can be an intensely private person when it comes to the big things in my life. And by some crazy chance a stranger is reading this- well- its nice to meet you:)  Its no big secret now that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected many- many lives. If not for the physical health- it has affected the mental health as well as the financial health of many- including myself.  Ive been lucky to work in the restaurant industry where Ive met many wonderful souls- the kind of people that have become life-long family and friends to me. The work we do is the humbling kind- the kind that is character-building and sure is not for the faint of hearts. Its our job to take care of people that sometimes we forget to take care of ourselves.  In the fall of 2019- I made the big decision of attending a coding bootcamp. Ive always loved taking care of people. But I found myself less and less able to give. I did it so much for my work that I didnt know if or when I would run out of my own kindness.  I found that with software engineering- I could still take care of people. Technology is behind just about most daily routines. Its not so obvious sometimes how it can be used in a mindful and thoughtful way. But I hope to find the right balance of technology and the human heart. After all- we thrive best not because of advanced medicine- breakthrough technology- or the newest gadgets. But because of human interaction- and just maybe the human design behind the software.  Big ideas take big risks. I wanted to continue to give without giving away my own self. And I could only do that by taking risk with myself first. I took out a loan for the bootcamp. I took time off from the restaurant and used up all my savings while spending 12 weeks learning how to code from scratch.  I knew it would take awhile to find a job afterwards. I knew Id have to go back to my restaurant family again- which honestly- by the end of the bootcamp- I had missed it dearly.  After the 3-month grace period (which is this month)- I had planned on selling my stocks to make loan payments. I would give myself a cushiony 6 months while I work part-time at the restaurant to cover rent and living expenses- and search for a software engineering job.  But I never planned for the coronavirus. I never planned for a pandemic that is now affecting us all. I never planned for my place of work to shut down for at least the next month through a state mandate. I never planned for this kind of uncertainty. (Lesson learned here dont leave my emergency fund in stocks.)  My priority right now is to be able to make rent- pay for health insurance- and cover food expenses. Ive also applied for forbearance on all my loans for the time being with pending approval (the good old student loans from college is still a thing- unfortunately.) And Im hoping to not take on any credit card debt while navigating through all this.  Ive never been shy at admitting my own mistakes or downfall- and asking for help. But I cant ever ask for help without offering something in return. If youre able to help me financially through this uncertain time- I promise to give in return.   Whatever you decide to gift me now- I will match 5% of that amount. The 5% will be donated to a charity of your choice. And the original amount will be returned to you (or you can choose to include this towards the donation.)    **Might I recommend something like the Restaurant Workers Community Foundation? There are plenty more like this one out there. But no matter the cause- there are no better or worst cause to support. Lets not get too philosophical with this one. We all have that one thing (or a few things) that is near and dear to our hearts.**   This has been an incredibly long message to read- and I appreciate you for sticking with me to the end. I dont know when Ill be able to fulfill this promise Im making. It may take months. It may take a year- or a few years. But I can shamelessly say that my best quality is never going back on my words.  Thank you all. Stay healthy out there.   Love- Ying",

   "title": "Logan Iowa Mayor Covid-19 Response Fund",
   "description": " The purpose of asking for help is to collect and funnel private donations to support people and families from Logan- IA who need help paying for groceries during the Covid-19 crisis.    And to encourage at-risk people to stay at home and take advantage of Logan Super Foods delivery service during the Covid-19 outbreak.  Cash donations from this campaign will buy groceries for people in need of food due to the Covid-19 virus outbreak. Please consider giving to our cause. 100% of funds collected will go to buy food.  If you are not sure about donating online--cash or check donations are being accepted at the Logan State Bank. Simply inform the bank clerk that you want your donation to go the \"\"grocery fund.\"\"  If half of Logans residents each donate $5 we would raise enough to support 75 families. Please consider donating today. Thank-you.  Contact mayor Clint McDonald for more information.   Details Below:  Donated funds are only available for people who have a Logan- IA address and who have self-identified as needing help during this time to buy groceries at Logan's only grocery store.  Available only for groceries that are delivered directly to the homes from Logan Super Foods. This program is designed to give help to at-risk people/families that have decided to self-isolate during the Covid-19 crisis and who need help with paying for groceries regardless of cause.  Impacted families need to reach out to Mayor Clint McDonald by calling his home telephone number. Or by calling the Logan City Hall and asking for the Mayor's cell number. Once residents contact the Mayor- he will fill them in on additional information and issue the $50 grocery voucher. Residents in need can also reach out to one of the 3 other oversight committee members listed below.    The committee will then issue a $50 grocery voucher to the individuals needing assistance on a first come first serve basis. The vouchers are worth a maximum of $50 and any unused portion of the $50 voucher will go back into the fund to help other Logan residents.   Residents receiving vouchers can only use one voucher at a time- and only on the days that Logan Super Foods is offering the delivery option during the Covid-19 crisis- (Monday- Wednesday- Friday and Saturday). With a total limit of $100 dollars per week per address. This limit is so we can reach as many people in need as possible. For larger families living at the same address more than one $50 voucher may be issued with approval from the oversight committee- based on donated funds available.  Once residents have been given a $50 voucher number all they have to do is simply call Logan Super Foods 644-2280 to place their orders and determine delivery times. The committee will reimburse Logan Super Foods for every voucher used. Remember delivery is only available for Mondays- Wednesdays- Friday and Saturday.  Donated funds will be limited to food and other necessities such as fever reducing medications. Alcohol- tobacco products and other non-essential items are not eligible for this voucher program.  An over-sightcommittee consisting of Chris Hartwig- Kim Fisher and Brianne Niedermeyer has been set-up to oversee all processes. At no time will the committee ever release the names and private information of Logan residents who have reached out for help.  One hundred percent of the donated funds that we receive will be dispersed to support individuals and families as outlined above. Mayor Clint McDonald or the oversight committee will not retain any portion of donated funds to cover administration costs.   When the Covid-19 crisis has passed- all unused funds from private donations will be donated to the Logan Iowa Senior Center Meal Site and the West Central Community Action food pantry in Logan- IA.  Our goal is to raise $15-000 so that we can help 150 to 300 families based on need for the duration of the Covid-19 crisis. If more funds are raised- we will be able to help more people. Another way to look at is If half of Logans residents each give $5 we would raise enough support for 75 families. No amount is too little to donated and every donation will be appreciated.  The program is limited to the funds available at the time that the resident contacts the Mayor. If no funds are available at that time- a list will be kept in the case additional funds come available. These funds will then be available on a first come first serve basis.  Due to the timeliness of this issue- the committee did not have time to set-up a tax-exempt status. So donating to this cause is not tax deductible to our understanding. Contact your tax adviser for more information.  Lastly- this is not a function of Logan City Government. It has been done with all volunteer efforts- and at no time were taxpayer funds or city resources used to establish this fund or administer this program. This is solely a donation device to funnel funds to needy individuals as outlined above. Due to the nature of this program and the daily unpredictability of events surrounding the Covid-19 crisis we will do our best to serve all those that come to our attention but we cannot make any commitments that we will be able to serve everyone equally. It will truly be administered on a first come first serve basis while donated funds are available. The committee reserves the right to end the program at any time.  Thank-you-  Mayor Clint McDonald",

   "description": "PayPal:   https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8nIyHruSxE   Wir alle erleben momentan- welche dramtischen Auswirkungen COVID-19 auf die europäischen Staaten hat. Doch die afrikanischen Staaten trifft diese Viruserkrankung -obwohl sie dort gerade erst beginnt sich auszubreiten  bereits jetzt sehr schwer. Von unseren Freunden in Uganda wissen wir- dass bereits jetzt die Preise für Lebensmittel und Hygieneartikel- wie zum Beispiel Seife- so hoch sind- dass es sich eine normal verdienende Familie nicht mehr leisten kann- Lebensmittel zu kaufen. Das öffentliche Leben wurde wie auch in den europäischen Ländern weitestgehend eingestellt- sodass das nötige Gehalt fehlt um die Familie zu ernähren. Arbeitslosengeld oder Krankenversicherungen - Fehlanzeige. Dies ist neben der ständigen Angst zu erkranken und kein Geld für die Versorgung in einem Krankenhaus zu haben natürlich mehr als belastend. Auerdem wurde der Betrieb der öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel weitgehend eingestellt- sodass eine Nahrungsmittelbeschaffung extrem erschwert ist. Zudem erreichten uns Bilder von Nahrungsmittelraub. Der Druck von Seiten des Militärs ist deutlich spürbar.  Und Familien mit schwerstmehrfachbehinderten Kindern- die zur sogenannten Risikogruppe gehören- trifft es noch einmal umso härter. Durch die Schlieung der Schulen sind die Eltern gezwungen ihre Kinder zu Hause zu versorgen und haben somit keinerlei Verdienst- da sie nicht arbeiten gehen können  die Chance sich noch Lebensmittel oder Hygienartikel wie zum Beispiel Seife leisten zu können sinkt somit immer weiter. Und da gerade diese Kinder eine groe Gefahr haben- einen sehr schweren - wenn nicht lebensbedrohlichen Verlauf der Erkrankung - zu haben- ist es umso wichtiger ihr Immunsystem zumindest auch durch Vorbeugen einer Mangelernährung so weit wie möglich zu stärken.   Das Angels Center ist eine seit 7 Jahren existierende Einrichtung für geistig und körperlich behinderte Kinder in Uganda. Die Kinder erhalten hier Physiotherapie- Logopädie und werden  je nach Ausprägung ihrer Behinderung  auch unterrichtet und erhalten vor allen Dingen ganz viel Liebe und Zuneigung. Für mehr Informationen zur Organisation:   http://angelscentre.org    Die Projektleiterin Rosemary Nambooze hat einen 9-jährigen Sohn- der mit dem Down Syndrom geboren wurde. Rosemary war zum Zeitpunkt der Geburt gerade in Antwerpen- wo sie ihr Studium beendete und durfte dort erleben- wie liebevoll man mit ihrem Sohn umgegangen ist. Zurück in Uganda setzte sie sich dann für die Rechte von Kindern und Jugendlichen mit Behinderungen ein. So entstand das Angels Center. Rosemary betreibt das Projekt mit viel Herz und versucht gleichzeitig Aufklärungsarbeit zu leisten und den Menschen in Uganda zu zeigen: Kinder mit Behinderung verdienen die gleiche Liebe und Anerkennung- wie jedes andere Kind auch. Und genau diese Liebe und Anerkennung brauchen die Kinder in dieser schwierigen Zeit umso mehr!   Wir sind uns darüber bewusst- dass im Moment auch hier in Europa schwierige Umstände herrschen. Das rzte und Pflegekräfte überlastet sind- das unsere Gesundheitssysteme an ihre Grenzen stoen und auch wir hier verzweifeln  auch wirtschaftlich. Aber alle von uns haben Nahrung im Haus  niemand von uns muss Angst haben zu verhungern. Wir haben ein funktionierendes Sozialsystem und viele ehrenamtliche Helfer- die versuchen alle Menschen bestmöglich aufzufangen. All dies fehlt in Uganda. Menschen fürchten nun nicht nur aufgrund von COVID-19  sondern auch aus Angst- keine Nahrung mehr zu haben - um ihr Leben. Und vielleicht habt ihr ja den ein oder anderen Euro übrig- um zumindest den Familien des Angels Centers etwas Geld für Nahrung zu spenden. Wir sind ehemalige Freiwillige des Projekts und haben sowohl zu Rosemary als auch zu den Familien der Kinder engen persönlichen Kontakt  garantieren also dafür das euer Geld ankommt und auch wirklich dafür genutzt wird- Nahrung für die Familien zu kaufen.

   "description": "Hospitals are running low on one-time use N95 masks that will protect them from COVID-19 (Coronavirus) when dealing with patients- so in an attempt to help solve this issue- a few friends and I have been 3D printing masks to make up for this lack of masks. One hospital-issue N95 mask can be cut up into small circles and placed in the small screw-in filter capsules for a longer use period and a more efficient mask that can be cleaned and is durable enough to withstand wear for long periods of time. Any donations will be used to purchase printers and filament to continue printing and sending masks out to those who need them the most. Each mask takes about 3-4 hours to print in good quality. Each filter capsule takes about 1.5-2 hours to print- so more filament and printers are needed to continue this effort. Thank you for your support and donations!",

Appeal for help and donations for the Health Center   Hospital in Konjic in the fight against the COVID-19 virus pandemic   In consideration of the evolving situation regarding the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and the fact that the City of Konjic could become the new epicenter for COVID-19 in Bosnia and Herzegovina- and given the fact that the hospital does not yet have a ward to accommodate such patients- nor adequate equipment or funds- we have initiated this action to donate funds to purchase equipment and/or other materials needed to combat the corona virus as efficiently as possible. Also- the Konjic Health Center- which is currently the first line of defense- is in a very difficult financial situation- and the funds raised will be allocated between the needs of the Konjic Health Center and the Hospital.

La Regione Lazio ha disposto la trasformazione del Presidio Columbus-  struttura gestita dal Policlinico Gemelli  in Covid Hospital Regionale per prendere in carico pazienti affetti o casi sospetti di Covid-19 al fine di supportare lHub Regionale - Ospedale Spallanzani e fronteggiare lemergenza sanitaria in atto.  Pertanto- nelle prossime tre settimane- il Policlinico Gemelli avvier la trasformazione del Presidio Columbus in un Centro interamente dedicato ad accogliere e trattare pazienti con Coronavirus Covid-19 mettendo a disposizione  80 posti letto singoli  (specialit infettivologia- pneumologia e medicina interna) e  59 posti letto di terapia intensiva.     Il costo di un singolo posto di terapia intensiva è di circa 70.000.   Al momento lOspedale ha bisogno di dispositivi di protezione come misure di contenimento dell'infezione da Covid-19 come le Mascherine chirurgiche- le Mascherine filtranti FFP2 e FFP3- ma anche Tute Tyvek e Occhiali di sicurezza.   Attualmente le previsioni di consumo sono ingenti- che necessitano di un approvvigionamento costoso e continuo.   Non ultimo la necessit di sistemi di ventilazione che rappresentano al momento un altro importante tassello nella cura dei pazienti affetti da Covid-19. ll costo di un solo ventilatore polmonare per la Terapia intensiva è prossimo ai 20.000.    un progetto complesso che dobbiamo realizzare con urgenza: per questo anche il tuo aiuto è importante.    La solidariet e la collaborazione di tutti è fondamentale in questo momento- per svolgere al meglio il nostro lavoro- per tutelare la salute dei nostri professionisti e di conseguenza garantire e proteggere nelle migliori condizioni anche quella dei nostri pazienti.",

Its not like I was given two weeks notice- just like that no income.   This has lead to a number of complications as I am living paycheck to paycheck. I will be unable to afford rent- needed medications for my sick wife- and also to pay for utilities- food and other basic needs.  I really don't like to ask for help and would normally not do this but in order to pay for these basic necessities I am asking for your compassion in this time of need.  I am doing my part trying to get work from home but unfortunately my laptop is broken so I have to resort to trying to use a computer.

   "description": "Hi You all-   As we all know that the World Health Organization declares the rapid coronavirus outbreaks a pandemic. The virus has been almost all around the globe. Over 114 countries became a victim of this virus.   There are above 130-000 cases that have been recorded and over 5000 death. the number of cases is still increasing rapidly.   A brief description of what Coronavirus is: Coronaviruses (CoVid-19) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID -19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.   Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms- fever- cough- shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases- an infection can cause pneumonia- severe acute respiratory syndrome- kidney failure- and even death  The purpose of all this information is to ask you guys or think about the people who are in need of help. Its time for us to support people who are in financial crises and lost their jobs or cant go to work because their work is closed. Think about it- they have a family to feed- they have rent to pay- bills to pay- and many more you name it- and they are facing all those problems right now with no support.   I want you guys to support me on this journey. Do good by giving back. I am so excited and honored to start this charity for people who are in need of this. I want to help them with everything I can whether its a grocery- rent- bills- education expense anything.100% of this money goes to the people in need. I am asking you guys to spread the wings and lets help each other at this time. Lets tell them they are not alone during this time- lets have each other back.   Spread Love  Hina Tanoli",

The children who attend Park School have developmental- intellectual- and physical disabilities and medically complex conditions. Most of them require full-time support for some- if not all- activities of daily living.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic- Park- along with all District 65 schools in Evanston- IL- just outside Chicago- will be closed from Monday- March 16 through April 12. Education will continue at home- with remote support from teachers and staff.   This hiatus- as well as social distancing practices- present significant logistical and financial challenges to many of our families.   Caring for children with medical complexities is a full time job. Families of children who attend Park often have limited physical and financial resources to care for their children at home on a 24/7 basis- especially on an unplanned basis.  We are raising funds during the COVID-19 crisis to meet a wide range of extraordinary needs of Park families including:   --full- or part-time childcare providers who are qualified to meet the needs of their children;    --emergency backup care to care for the child in the event family caregiver(s) become ill and are unable to provide care;    --extraordinary needs for specialized supplies for the care of their children;    --extraordinary needs for nutritional supports- such as blended diets- not provided through public free meal distribution for youths.   We are working closely with Park staff to identify the needs of our community.  Your donation will allow the Park PTA to provide grants to families in response to those needs. Every dollar will help.   Thank you in advance!",

   "description": "COVID-19- GTA BLACK COMMUNITY EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUND   The public health response to the COVID19 virus requires social distancing- and as a result- many things are being cancelled to keep the community safe. These closures are important and necessary. They do however have impacts on the many people in our community- particularly those who are working in the gig economy freelancers- artists- performers- servers- service workers- etc. Many in our communities have lost their income source for the foreseeable future.   Additionally- school closures- while necessary- impact the many families who rely on the school meal program to feed their children- and many are already- or soon will be- missing work to care for loved ones. In short- many of us are finding ourselves financially short as the month rolls out.   Black Lives Matter- Toronto is launching a fundraising campaign to create a GTA Black Community Emergency Support Fund for Black folks in the GTA who need extra support during these times.   We will be giving out one time stipends of $125 or $250 to Black people through an online application process- depending on need (please self-assess). As we need this fund to reach as many people as possible please only apply once; there will be one time access only. We will continue to fundraise so we are able to give out as many as possible.   TO ACCESS THE GTA BLACK COMMUNITY EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUND   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhYyxDb9swO8f_7vQafrswZp9wxIaXr6pEr90BTY5G-yoG2w/viewform?usp=sf_link     Can you help us raise some funds to support our communities? Lets work together to provide mutual aid and ensure that Black people in Tkaronto have what they need to survive this crisis.   TO DONATE TO THE GTA BLACK COMMUNITY EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUND   https://www.gofundme.com/f/black-emergency-support-fund?utm_source=customer utm_medium=copy_link-tip utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet       WHO SHOULD APPLY   This is an EMERGENCY FUND for Black individuals living in the GTA. Specifically- we want to support individuals who- as a result of the pandemic- have lost income and are at a loss for how to fill their revenue sources- who now have unforeseen childcare costs- folks who have to find the money for children's food now that schools are closed- artists- freelancers- and gig gig economy workers who have lost out on gigs- seniors and elders in our communities- disabled folks- folks who are facing daily challenges of capitalism and are living on or near the street.   We ask you to self-assess based on need; and we want to prioritize those who do not have financial alternatives such as investments- employment- or other sources of income.    IMPORTANT NOTE   This fund is created based on a shared community trust system. We want to reduce the barriers that invasive questions do to accessing support- while being as accountable and transparent to the community.   To that end- funds will be given out on a first-come-first-served basis. We want to honour this commitment by trusting that those who have the means will seek out those means- and leave this fund to be accessed by those of us who are now left with little to no choice.   This fund is limited. Utilizing community donations- we will continue to hand out funds for as long as we can- but recognize that this too will not be sufficient to bridge the deep gaps that this crisis has caused.   To preserve each others privacy and dignity- we will never publish the names or details of the recipients- but will give periodic updates to our community on the number of people who have been served by this fund    OTHER SOURCES OF SUPPORT   BLACK CREEK COMMUNITY FARM EMERG FOOD BOXES (JANE   FINCH COMMUNITY)  Emergency Food Boxes are available- and delivered by Food Share Toronto to your home.

We are working with Palav- a non-profit organization in the medical field- to raise funds for hospitals that are being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. There are currently more than 5-000 cases (and growing) in Michigan- and the number of deaths has doubled in the last two weeks. Due to this- we have decided to raise money that will go to hospitals to help treat the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals are in a dire need for more supplies/equipment to treat patients and might even need funds for food to help doctors get through their shifts. Any donation is greatly appreciated!  Right now the two hospitals that will be getting these donations are Henry Ford Health System in Michigan and Beaumont Health System in Michigan. These two health systems are caring for more than 2-000 COVID-19 patients at their hospitals- and they need the most help. As our funds grow- we will be reaching out to more health systems and hospitals in Wayne- Oakland- and Macomb Counties.  Once again- thank you for viewing our page. Every donation counts!! It would also be great if you guys can keep sending this link to more people to raise awareness and funds for the hard-working doctors in these health systems.    Yash Potdukhe:   Shrihan Nalamati:",

   "description": "On March 16- we were forced to lay off our employees and close our dining room in order to stop the spread of COVID19.  Since then- we have signed up with food delivery apps Door Dash and Uber Eats and we converted our space to provide only take-out and delivery.  But it has proven not to be enough. Not even close.  We need your help to keep us alive. Banu will not survive this.   The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses says one third of its members who own small independent businesses say they will not last the month as a result of COVID19.   Unfortunately- our drastic drop in sales did not begin with the mandated closure of restaurants in Ontario or with the WHO announcement of COVID19 as a pandemic. It began when E - ron became one of the epicentres of coronavirus- back in February.    As an E - run - yen restaurant - we immediately began to see a drop in sales and a cancellation of reservations.  It was / is extremely worrying for us and for our staff.   There is no date set as to when restaurants can once again open their doors in Toronto and many experts say this could last right into the summer and perhaps fall.  The government is providing wage subsidies but we dont know the details yet and who will and won't qualify. The government also says it will make it easier to acquire a small business loan. But all of this just means more debt and it only benefits the banks.  As a family run independently owned business we cannot afford to take on more debt and so we are reaching out to our community and not the banks.  For 15 years we have been fortunate enough to be a hub for our community. We are now asking for your help.   We know that these are difficult times for many- but for those who are in a position to help- any amount is appreciated.  We look forward to serving you again.

   "description": "Dear Givers-  This fund is specifically for women of color working artists or creatives that have been directly impacted financially in light of COVID-19.  Whether it be performances- teaching artist gigs- freelancing- or any other creative income- many artists have had an unexpected loss of revenue without a definitive date for resuming consistent compensation. Taking into consideration race and gender- women of color have been disproportionately affected by the economic disparities that the pandemic continues to highlight. What this fund aims to do is relieve immediate needs of women of color through financial support: whether that be rent- groceries- technical device bills medical needs etc.  As we are- in what feels like- the height of an era -- women of color artists/creatives continue to do the unimaginable work of telling the story- resisting oppression and using art to liberate our society. It is important to protect the voices that are our world's pillars- and yet- the most vulnerable in regards to systemic oppression.   We are asking you to contribute what you are able to- to help meet the needs of WOC artists. If you are in the position to give- please know that any offering will provide both practical and drastic help for people. No amount is too small and every penny counts towards the survival and sustenance for women of color creatives. It is because of your giving- that we can continue to carry on into our next breath.  With sincerity and urgency- we thank you for your support during this time of need. Your contribution shifts worlds and lives that you may or may not be able to witness. We offer you much gratitude- wish you good health and hope for you- protected health.  Thank you- thank you and thank you.  Sincere regards- Ramya Ramana",

   "description": "To our many dear customers in the past 13 years- our beloved friends-    we start by saying  Thank You - because many of you have already helped us- by entrusting us with shaping a small part of your experiences and memories of Rome. Maybe you remember it still - recently or many years ago  on a bicycle- in the fresh morning air or in the golden light of the afternoon- cruising the back alleys of Trastevere or riding along the monumental arches of the Roman aqueducts. Perhaps you still remember your guides name - and just maybe- they brought magic to this experience- making it one of your best-loved memories of Rome.   On behalf of all our staff and guides- we thank you as it has been an honor to have you tour with us and thus support us in what we love doing best!   And we never thought wed ever need to ask for anything more... until last month.  In the first week of March- the rapid and devastating spread of the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy hit us hard and fast - wrecking the hitherto successful activity of our shop.    We went from business-as-usual to closing the front door in under 3 weeks.  In what is normally the lead up to the busiest period of the year- our shop has been shut and our staff has stopped working. A couple of us still continue to work a few hours from home  mainly on the cancellations and refunds that have cleaned dry all income prospects for many months to come.   To say the truth- this caught us unprepared.  Weve ran our business in the past 13 years with very low margins of profit (in order to ensure the best quality at the lowest price) and we dont have any funds to fall back to in an emergency such as this one.  And even with that- this wouldnt be as bad if it didnt come after 5 difficult winter months- during which weve accrued debts - which now keep growing daily- and by all accounts will continue to do so for many months to come-  threatening our survival . It is true- in this crisis- we have some help: the Italian government pledged (limited and short-term) assistance measures; but having done the math with it we hardly stand a chance if the crisis lasts longer than a few months.  And this is still not the last of our worries.  We also think of our freelance guides- who- not being entitled to any government aid- are set to remain financially wholly unsupported for most or all of the season ahead.  We just hate seeing this and feeling unable to do anything to help them.  It is these unprecedented circumstances that drive us to appeal to you- our old customers and friends- for any help you may be willing and able to spare. We hate to ask- and we would have happily avoided doing so if we had any other possibility to turn to.    We ask reluctantly- but knowing that in these hard times- no contribution can be too small or superfluous or insignificant- and we would be forever grateful to you for helping us out- if you can do so.  To us it could make the difference between success and defeat. And it goes without saying- we would love to be there for you again- on your next visit to Rome!  If this call for help succeeds- we plan to use half of whatever funds we manage to gather to shore up our company finances and half to be distributed between our guides.   Please stay well and stay safe-  Your TopBike Team  ---  (some of our guides)  Our Akram (lower left) on the Via Appia   Our Elena in the back-alleys of Rome   Our Edoardo just after a punchline (right)   Our Klaas just before starting on a tour",

Per chi non è pratico spigo subito i numeri verdi italiani come funzionano:  PER CHI CHIAMA E' GRATUITO  ma- le spese sono a carico di chi risponde.  Un webmaster ha deciso anche di creare un sito web- dove ci saranno i recapiti per mettersi in contatto con i Volontari- ma- per far si che le persone ci trovino e che quindi possano trovare una valvola di sfogo- dobbiamo sostenere dei costi pubblicitari- su Facebook- su Twitter e su google.

   "description": "Hey Team!  With the recent COVID-19 outbreak- Sandrew and Meghan had to make the devastating decision to close the doors of both Saskatoon's F45 locations in order to protect the health and safety of their member- staff- and community. After everything that they have done for their members and community- this is our chance to give back to them. As new business owners with no income- and a SIGNIFICANT loss of potential and existing members and bills still to pay- both locations and Meghan and Sandrew personally will take a major financial hit. As a community I thought this would be the perfect time for us to step up and support them through this difficult time to prevent them from losing anymore than they already may have. Regardless of the gym being closed- they still have payments- rent- bills- and other business related expenses they they need to pay on top of their personal expenses. Please consider donating any amount that you are able to- to help them in this stressful time. I know many of us may be going through similar struggles and it may not be financially possible but even a small amount can help! Something to consider that they graciously paused ALL memberships to help us in this time- even though that is their revenue- so a suggestion would be to donate a portion of- or the total cost of your membership to help them through this unbelievably challenging time. As they always say we are more than a gym- we are a community- so lets come together and show them that the community they have created for all of us cares about them and is here for them the same way they are always here for us!",

   "description": "OUR STORY   We are an entrepreneurial group of Harvard Business School Owner/Management Program classmates from 33 different countries who have gotten our last Unit 3 cancelled after a week of class in March 2020 due to the global coronavirus pandemic- postponing our graduation from the program. At least 3 out of 150 classmates have tested positive for the coronavirus and there has been overwhelming emotional support in our WhatsApp group. Just earlier this year in January and February 2020- some classmates procured and donated at least thousands of masks to help combat the coronavirus crisis in China. In the blink of an eye- it has shifted to Europe and now US cases are rising dramatically every day to become the next epicenter of the pandemic. Other parts of the world will follow soon after.  As China resumes mask production- we have leveraged our network and procurement experience to donate masks to the US and other parts of the world. Soon we realized its more than just our friends- families- and classmates. Many hospitals havent prepared for the pandemic and currently they are urgently short of medical supplies. We are here to channel the resources in the most efficient way. We want to help protect our frontline healthcare workers and restore their confidence for the battle theyre fighting every day.   OUR GOAL   Our goal is to save millions of lives by raising capital to acquire masks- personal protective equipment(PPE)- ventilators- and other medical supplies for frontline healthcare workers starting from the US and expanding to other parts of the world. Priority will be given to current pandemic epicenters such as New York City. Please fill out this form to request medical supplies:  Million Lives:PPE Request Form   First $10-000 committed will acquire over 20-000 FDA cleared surgical masks to arrive Thursday- April 2nd in NYC  +$30-000 will acquire over 60-000 FDA cleared surgical masks to arrive by Monday April 6th in NYC/DC/Brazil (GRU Airport)  +$60-000 will acquire medical supplies to arrive by Monday April 13th to locations based on the survey responses  If we go beyond our goal- we will acquire additional shipments to help new epicenters make it through the peak of the epidemic.   WHAT WE DO   We have direct relationships with FDA-cleared suppliers in China and other parts of the world and building up suppliers in other parts of the world. We are already in touch with many large medical health systems across the US such as Mount Sinai Health System- Carepoint Health- Johns Hopkins Hospital- UCSF- and UCSD Medical Group. We will work with our classmates and friends to donate supplies to larger hospitals as well as smaller community hospitals in underprivileged areas. Hospitals have cash flow issues due to cancelling non-critical surgeries- but if they are able to donate/reimburse back the cost of the supplies then we can use the funds to procure the next batch of supplies.   OUR COMMITMENT   100% of the funds (aside from Gofundmes fees) will go directly to the purchase and delivery of medical supplies for frontline healthcare workers. Once the medical supplies are delivered- we will list the donation amount and locations- and post any pictures and videos.

FAQ    Q: How will the funds be used?   To date- many US hospitals have been unable to access these equipment stocks due to language/cultural barriers and many foreign suppliers require up-front payment instead of the usual 30-90 day payment terms. We solve both problems by aggregating the suppliers and underwriting the cost to bring the equipment to the US.  Our current primary goal is to get as many FDA-cleared medical supplies into the hands of frontline healthcare workers as soon as possible. 100% of the funds will go directly to facilitating the purchase and delivery of masks and other urgent PPE for frontline healthcare workers in the US. Please fill out this form to request medical supplies:  Million Lives:PPE Request Form    Q: Why US first?   The U.S. has become the next epicenter of coronavirus pandemic. New York City accounts for 6% of global cases as of March 25th. We hope that we can help the US hospitals first and expand to other countries with our efforts.   Q: How can we help aside from donations?   If you want to share sources of suppliers- help distribute medical supplies- help distribute this initiative or promote this initiative in the press- please email: schan@opm54.hbs.edu   Q: Are donations tax deductible?   In the interest of getting these medical supplies into the hands of doctors and nurses as quickly as possible- the donations are currently not tax deductible. We are working on a structure to run this through a 501c3 and will let you all know as soon as that happens.",

   "title": "Covid 19 Relief - Malaysian Students in UK & Eire",
   "description": "On the 11th March 2020- the World Health Organisation (WHO) had characterised the Covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic. In light of the Covid-19 outbreak- this unprecedented situation has created a challenging and stressful period to Malaysian students in the UK and Ireland collectively due to the uncertainties pertaining to the situation. A vast majority of students cannot afford one-way trips from the UK/Ireland to Malaysia under the current average prices across different airlines. The cost of those flights back to Malaysia will place a significant financial burden on the students.   The Covid-19 pandemic has come abruptly at an extremely frustrating time. For Malaysian students in the UK and Ireland- this has come in the midst of ongoing seminars and lectures a few months prior to summer examination and graduation. With the total number of cases in the United Kingdom rising beyond 8-000- majority if not all universities have allowed and advised international students to head back home.   However- for some Malaysian students- a flight back home is a luxury they simply cannot afford- potentially leaving them stranded. Based on a welfare aid scheme survey distributed by UKEC- we have gathered that some of the applicants who are in financial predicaments have family members with pre-existing health conditions and are in urgent need to return home; a few who have lost their part-time job in the UK and Ireland and can no longer support their tuition and rental fees- resulting in them being evicted from their accommodation; some whose parents have lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic and others who simply cannot afford to pay for the ridiculously priced flights (150-300% price hike) back home.  In collaboration with KPUM- GenCorporate- KBR- EMAN UKE- BPN UK- MPUK- The Kalsom Movement- The Charisma Movement and The Hubb Movement- we are launching this peer-to-peer crowdfunding campaign to help raise money and provide welfare assistance in the form of a partial subsidy to those who have been enduring hard times amidst this outbreak. Funds raised will be directed to help 25 severely affected students filtered from a pool of 195 applicants. We are aiming to raise £5-000 in total by the 1st of April 2020 to help aid the deserving students who are stranded in the UK and Ireland to relieve their plights. Nevertheless- we would like note that- even with the partial subsidy- some of the recipients may still struggle to purchase a flight ticket to return home. Therefore- the received aids are permitted to be used in other areas of necessities such as rent-paying or buying food supplies. The list of recipients are stated below:  1. Tan Ai Shern (University of Nottingham) 2. Su Yi Low (Swansea University) 3. Reenadesh Kaur (Aberystwyth University) 4. Syahmi Izzuddin Samsudin (University of Manchester) 5. Edmund How (Plymouth University) 6. Ainul Nadirah Izaharuddin (University of Glasgow) 7. Ng Wei Jie (University of Southampton) 8. Lynn Chiam Hui Theen (Letterkenny Institute of Technology) 9. Ian Chiam (Limerick Institute of Technology) 10. Ong Zhen Jin (University of Sunderland) 11. Wan Hua Teoh (City- University of London) 12. Wan Yi Teoh (University of Liverpool) 13. Connie Ho (University of Leeds) 14. Pei Xuan Chan (Birmingham City University) 15. Cheah Shu Wei (University of Surrey) 16. Benjamin Koo Wei Jie (University of Manchester) 17. Wan Jamilah binti Hj Wan Yussof (Dublin Business School) 18. Devanesh Gunasingam (University of Dundee) 19. Daniel Chung Jau Ying (University of Southampton) 20. Michelle Tiong Mei Zhen (Queens University Belfast) 21. Muhamad Haziq Bin Abdul Hadi (University of Edinburgh) 22. Choong Shu Wan (City Law School) 23. Low Sze Ling (University of Manchester) 24. Marzarith Sofea (University of Essex) 25. Lyana binti Norhan (University of Strathclyde)   Extra funds raised will be donated to other NGOs fighting for the same cause. Lets extend our thoughts and assistance to those in need during these tough times- together! #kitajagakita     * UKEC - an acronym for the United Kingdom and Eire (Ireland) Council for Malaysian Students is a non-profit student organisation that acts as the umbrella body and national coalition of all Malaysian student societies across the United Kingdom and Ireland. Currently- over 79 Malaysian societies are its constituent members- with UKEC serving as an integral platform representing the collective interests of over 18-000 Malaysian students in the UK and Ireland. Our mission is to contribute towards nation building by championing student activism and looking out for the welfare of our students.  ** UKEC will transfer the financial aid to the recipients listed above through its UK bank account in advance of drawing out the donations raised via this Gofundme campaign due to its ability to rollover larger monetary amounts. UKEC's Treasury Office has also authorised Christopher Lim Khai Min- the Vice-Chairperson of UKECatalyst to withdraw the donations upon the campaign's conclusion. All donations shall be strictly channeled towards the financial assistance programme (additional funds raised will be donated to other NGOs fighting for the same cause).",

Continuano a dirci che \"\"gi stare a casa significa fare la nostra parte per combattare il Coronavirus (COVID-19)\"\". Tutto ciò é sicuramente vero- e ne approfitto per ricordarvi di  stare a casa  (se potete)!  Ma per me non è abbastanza....Così mi sono informata- per capire cosa serva al territorio della Provincia di Lecco- e data l'elevata richiesta di mascherine da parte di tutti i presidi sanitari della zona- ho deciso di dare il via ad una campagna di raccolta fondi con l'obbiettivo di acquistare 1.000 mascherine da distribuire ai presidi sanitari del territorio (Ospedale Manzoni di Lecco e Ospedale Mandic di Merate).  Non senza qualche timore- ho deciso di provarci e per raggiungere l'obiettivo che mi sono posta (1000 mascherine FFP2 per affrontare l'emergenza COVID-19) servono 5.000. Le mascherine provengono da un fornitore cinese- che garantisce la consegna in 7-10 giorni.  Venerdì prossimo (27/03) sar il mio compleanno- e per una volta-  vorrei essere io a fare un regalo invece di riceverlo . Vi chiedo di aiutarmi a raggiungere questa cifra- in modo da far partire l'ordine il prima possibile.  Grazie a tutti quelli che contribuiranno a questa campagna: un piccolo gesto  per aiutare chi ci sta aiutando  quotidianamento lavorando  in prima linea   3",

   "description": "The Royal Free Hospital London NHS is made up of the most amazing people who are being asked to put themselves in the front line to look after our loved ones. It is wonderful to see so many initiatives to help the NHS- however we are addressing a specific issue to provide support to the Acute Covid Medical Response Unit at The Royal Free.  We want to help our local hospital and specifically ensure that there is a hot meal available to the doctors who are on duty and working incredibly long hours. Here is a note below sent from one of the Consultants in this department.   Many thanks for so kindly having covered the hot food deliveries for our team of night time Doctors at the Royal Free Hospital in the last week.   This is invaluable help given the large workload faced by a team of doctors on the front line.    Usually we would have five doctors on any given night shift who would cover the acute medical admission and Inpatient wards. This team has been increased to 40 on-site doctors per night shift who have been pulled in from o  ther hospital and GP placements. They are on a rota of three nights on- three nights off which is a very tough schedule. As you can imagine- their access to no hot food in the hospital coupled with massively long hours was raised as an immediate concern to address. The hospital still cant provide hot food to the team of doctors and so we have relied on local communities to help in whichever way to allow for the provision of hot food at night. Having done the night shifts- the time saved in procuring different foods and also allowing the team to take a meal together has proved to be one the best morale boosters in these times of greatest challenge facing our lifetime careers in Medicine.     I am most grateful for all your help in easing the stressful circumstances we are facing and will keep you updated with pictures and statements from the doctors for whom your kindness is resulting in direct improvement of their  well being    Best Wishes    Dr Amir Jehangir    Consultant - Acute Medicine   Royal Free Hospital   Please give generously so that we in the local community can provide the support system they need to cope for the coming months. Each week we will provide funds directly to the lead doctor to ensure the whole team is fed after a long shift. We hope £25k will be sufficient funding for the doctors for 3 months.  We will provide the funds through a dedicated prepaid credit card that will be given to the lead consultant to use on a daily basis.  All donations will make an immediate impact and if we raise incremental funds then we will be able to extend the period beyond 3 months.  We would like to add our sincere thanks to Spielburger Restaurant (Hampstead) and Maido Sushi who have kindly offered to provide a number of meals free of charge to the Acute Medical Response Unit.",

Those of us who have been deployed- or who have had family members or friends deployed overseas- to protect this country understand how difficult that can be. As hard as that already is- our troops overseas are effected by the Coronavirus too.  With the spread and fear of COVID-19 I want to urge people- do not forget about the men and women in uniform protecting our country in active combat zones. While people in the US are over buying supplies for their homes- this doesnt leave much to be shipped overseas. I can speak from personal experienced when I tell you that the shortage of supplies that happen on a regular basis overseas- is a serious problem. COVID-19 just amplifies this issue.   If you want to make sure that supplies get to our heroes overseas in-spite of the pandemic and you have the resources to help- please consider making a small donation to help the cause. All money raised will go directly to personal hygiene kits- preventive medicine and vitamins supplies- educational material- and other essentials needed in Afghanistan.  If you are unable to donate- thats okay. First- I just ask that when youre in the store- please only buy what you need. Please leave enough supplies for other peoples families and for me to buy the supplies need to be sent overseas. And Second- if you took the time to read all of this- please say a prayer for everyone fighting for our freedom and those fighting the virus. Thank you and have a blessed day!!!",

The world needs to know about the recent COVID-19 Pandemic...how it started...where it came-from- and how it's come to be termed a 'Pandemic'.   Someone has to tell the 'real story'. Our Team is the first group to take that bold step. And with your support and participation...we can do it! The entire world will benefit by our production and by educating viewers about the COVID-19 outbreak!  We already have a 'Screenplay'...now we need Actors- Extra's- Additional Team Members...and everything that goes into producing a motion Picture.    To demonstrate the seriousness of this situation- President Trump issued this statement on March 11- 2020 from the White House- which we are presenting here under the Doctrine of Fair Use ...and to help educate the General Public as to the severity of the situation. See:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYZzNZvo0I0                    Photo Courtesy Centers For Disease Control/Atlanta   We believe that the whole world can benefit by exposure to the information we'll be presenting in the form of this movie. Of course- we'd like to attract some 'Big-Time' Actors...but we don't have a budget to do that and we are trying to pull this project together- literally- on a 'Shoestring'. We have the talent to do this project- already on board! And we have a 'Screenplay' which I wrote- and am donating to the project- free of charge.  What we need- now- is the funding and support of people like you- who are concerned about the planet and human beings...and people who really want to make a difference...but never really had the chance to do that.  Well- now's your chance to do that...get involved in something that matters!!! You'll never know if you don't try.... Who knows- by your participation...we might get an Academy Award...or you might be 'discovered' as the next 'John Wayne' or 'Marilyn Monroe'...who can say? One thing for certain-  if you do nothing and stay on the sidelines...you'll never know if you could have been great!  WHO WE ARE..........  Meet Our Team   Dr. Joseph A. Resnick- Executive Producer  Dr. Joseph A. Resnick has been involved in the film industry for over 30 years- chiefly in the area of motion picture finance. He was an early investor in several very successful productions through his early affiliation and finance in start-ups- like- Hard Rock Café- the movie- Ghost and several other major Hollywood productions. Dr. Joe- as he prefers to be addressed- is an avid supporter of the Arts- particularly those that involve complex- technical appearances- such as Jumping-through-walls (Dr. Joe developed this technique using CO2 emitted through a series of venturi affixed to the floor- pressurized to produce a wall- 10-feet high and 12 feet wide�used in the movie- Ghost- for example)- and other- complex- visually-challenging scenes- like- rocket lift-offs. You can learn more about Dr. Joes background at www.rmannco.com and  https://drjosephresnickcurriculumvitae.weebly.com/updates-page.html  .  Dr. Joe is the Author of the Screenplay- entitled- COVID-19�The Movie. The Screenplay has already been Copyrighted and Donors of $25.00 or more will each receive an electronic copy of the Screenplay.      Ms. Joyce M. Mann- Logistics- Planning and Production Coordinator  Ms. Joyce Joy Mann is our Logistics Director. Joy handles just about everything from helping to secure our shooting locations- interfacing with government agencies- police- military- etc.- so that we have legitimate access to locations in a safe and legal manner. Each state has a Film Office that facilitates film making in that particular state. In Joys past employment positions Joy interfaced with numerous state film agencies to help secure location- attract investors- to obtain grants (some states provide small grants as incentives to movie makers to locate in their state�this helps to bolster local economies). You can find more information about Joys background and experience at: www.rmannco.com .

Please donate money or non perishable goods that we can distribute to assist these families during the quarantine. We send you love and light and we all keep our mind positive . #bettertogether we will defeat this . Thank you Yolande and Mass",

   "description": "Objective:   We are organizing to provide financial emergency funding in order to directly and effectively support our most vulnerable students that have been displaced- impacted- and are in socioeconomic turmoil. This is imperative at a time where the college will not loosen its spring break work policies nor provide immediate relief to students disproportionately impacted by this crisis and the colleges decisions. We have been inspired by the many mutual aid funds and examples of community support proliferating in this time of crisis. This is a time to find resiliency and strength within our community and make our collective care felt. While we are all experiencing change and uncertainty at this time- we are hopeful that Carleton students- families and alumni with access to resources at this time can support the members of our community most impacted by this crisis.    Context:   On Thursday- March 12- 2020- Carleton College President Steve Poskanzer delivered Carletons response to COVID-19. In that response- Students were mandated to evacuate campus no later than Wednesday- March 18th. For those students unable to return home- a petition form was made to be filled out by those with circumstances requiring them to stay on-campus. However- such a petition had limited housing spaces available on campus- leaving a number of students dealing with various limitations. These limitations include but are not limited to housing insecurity- citizenship status- abusive homes- food insecurity- etc. Despite Carletons necessary decision to protect the health of both the Carleton community and Northfield- it has left first-generation- undocumented- low-income- international- or any combination of this list to encumber high levels of anguish and disempowerment. These burdens are linked to their unemployment status and inability to financially sustain themselves and their families in addition to the high financial and emotional cost of online learning as marginalized students.  Carleton also declared an added extension of one-week to our scheduled spring break to accommodate our campuss transition to remote online learning- which will begin April 6th- 2020. However- Carletons student employment policy over break requires students to be physically present on campus even in the midst of a global pandemic. Thus- rendering displaced vulnerable students with little to no resources. More information  here.      Mutual Aid Project:    First and foremost- this direct aid project is not endorsed or managed by Carleton College - this campaign is a product of and for first-generation- low-income students.   While we support the college's efforts to support first-generation- low-income students- we also acknowledge the limitations of some of these institutional pathways. Community member Shalin Carranza has continuously inquired about the emergency fund process being changed at a time of a crisis with no answers. This lack of transparency is frustrating. Additionally- The emergency fund through the Dean of Students Office has a strict monetary cap of $250. Such a cap fails to account for how $250 is nowhere near enough to support or alleviate our most vulnerable community members during this global crisis. Also- to receive emergency funding you have to write a detailed description of your emergency- which is a burden for most students having to disclose that sensitive information. Carleton released answers to FAQ on their COVID-19 FAQ page  (here) . A community member asked- will my financial aid change since Im not on campus? Carletons response was a hard no. Financial aid will not be adjusted despite knowing that families still incur costs when a student is at home- as well as unexpected expense to get home. In response to that blatant understatement- our objective with this project is to directly place the necessary funds into the pockets of high-need- at-risk students. We also accept any discontent or criticism such a project will invoke given that we are not officially working with the college but rather working as student organizers. However- this project is dire no matter the scrutiny. While we hope to collaborate with the college in the future to better serve its students' needs- we strongly hold that grassroots-organized- need-based relief is vital to mitigating the harmful impacts of COVID-19. To accomplish this effort- we will be reaching out to financially able community members- students- and alumni concerned with the socioeconomic wellbeing of at-risk students and asking them to donate. There will also be an attempt to collaborate with the Dean of Students Office- if possible- but please note that this collaboration is not a requirement to accomplish our goal.   Action Plan    We- Caro Carty ('20 )- Shalin Carranza ('20)- and Ozzy Cota ('22) have coordinated an email   social media campaign to crowd-source as many donations as possible to at-risk students. We created a google form asking for in-need students to provide their name- email address- class year- donation platform- and level of need on a 1-3 scale (more on that tiered system can be found below). Please note- that no disclosure of what or why a student is in need is required. A link to this google form can be found  here    1. Above all else- it is our intention to help at-risk students prepare for indefinite unemployment and its consequences. Therefore- we ask everyone who comes across this campaign to take into consideration both current and impending financial instability.   2.  The goal of this project is to directly distribute resources into the pockets of those who find themselves most at-risk and uncertain of their financial situation due to Carleton closing and extension of spring break. Many of us are in situations where we need to financially support our families or loved ones. The needs of our student body vary- and- for this reason- we are of the belief that direct financial donations are the most effective way to support FGLI students.   3.  We aim to keep this exchange between at-risk students and kind-hearted- able members of our community as equitable- efficient- and stress-free as possible.  These are our values and we hope that as a community we can uphold them as well as uplift our FGLI students.   Timeline:     March 18th:  Carleton closed campus to students- including those whose petitions to remain on campus were denied    March 20th:  GoFundMe is live. Email and publicity campaign starts.     March 21:  Carleton Student Association (CSA) Senate convenes from 12 pm - 2 pm (PST) to discuss the proposal and possible redistribution of institutional resources    March 27-30t h: First round of funds distributed- with funds distributed every five days following this initial transfer.    April 1st   Beyond: Funds will continue to be distributed   updates will be routinely made to the GoFundMe.    Tiered Redistribution System:     Level 1:  students request immediate financial assistance to cover relocation and travel fees. It is our goal to offer $1000 to these students in the initial round of transfers by April 1st.    Level 2:  students expressed the need for short term financial assistance to cover bills and groceries- as well as longer-term uncertainty about their future financial stability. It is our goal to offer these students an initial $1000 followed by an additional $1000 in installments until May 1st.    Level 3:  students request immediate and sustained financial support. It is our goal to offer these students an initial $1-000 in the first round of distribution and an additional $2-000 in installments until May 1st or until Funds last for a total of $3000.    Distribution Process:   Although a direct donation process by listing people's contact information would have been effective- it places FGLI student's private information at risk. Therefore- we are pooling and then redistributing the process in a transparent and equitable manner.    To ensure the security of FGLI students and this project's transparency- the person responsible for the redistribution of funds will be Ozzy Cota ('22)- one of the co-organizers of the project. Ozzy (They/Them pronouns) is a FGLI student who they and their family are facing significant income loss and inability to financially sustain themselves with two immunocompromised parents. Their father despite his pre-existing health complications is still working while their mother has been laid off with no health insurance or benefits. Thus- they understand first-hand the financial obstacles that fellow FGLI students are undergoing through this crisis. As such- Ozzy promises to distribute the funds transparently and equitably. The funds from the project will go into Ozzy's bank account. Once the deposit is complete- the funds will be redistributed through forms of checks and will reach out to students through the information inputted from the Google form. Once the identity of the student is verified- then the transaction will occur. If a check is causing unforeseen complications for a student then the transaction will happen over Zelle- Paypal- Cashapp- or Venmo. Ozzy will also continuously upload a verified copy of their bank statement to ensure transparency on transactions and movement of funds. This is a process that student-led associations at peer institutions have utilized and has been shown to be effective and trustworthy.  Any questions- comments or concerns feel free to reach out to either Caro Carty ( Cartyc@carleton.edu )- Shalin Carranza ( CarranzaS@carleton.edu )- or Ozzy Cota ( Cotao@carleton.edu )   Other Funds and Mutual Aid to Consider for Immediate Assistance    The  WFPC mutual aid fund  centers young women and trans   non-binary folks- specifically those who are Black- Indigenous- People of Color (BIPOC)- queer- and/or part of the disability community.

The app uses machine learning algorithm for possible EARLY case identification and contact tracing of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) cases to aid timely interventions using the predictive analytics- knowledge extraction and interpretation.  The app can trace contacts by generating physical movement data points. The app also provides an Uber map type GPS interface where the patient can choose and remotely video-consult with their local doctor (similar to hailing a uber driver).  The mobile app collects risk factors such as an individuals recent travel and contact history along with more common clinical manifestations and uses such collected data to assist in the preliminary screening and early identification of infected individuals.

   "description": "IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FOR INDIVIDUALS FINANCIALLY IMPACTED BY COVID-19 IN NYC.    Dear all- I am starting this fundraiser to aid those financially impacted by the social distancing movement in NYC. I am grateful that I am able to work from home and still get paid at my job- but it's made me realize that others are not so fortunate.  Many individuals are unable to work from home because of the nature of their jobs- but their hours are being cut regardless. Some of those immediately impacted are service industry workers- salon industry workers- and entertainment industry performers- aka people who rely on tips.   I am calling on the community and beyond to donate a tip- just for kicks. I don't have anything to give you in return- but hopefully we can come together in this time and help each other out. I'm not part of any organization- I'm just doing this on my own. If you are nervous to donate because you don't know me- I guess you're just going to have to trust a stranger.   HOW IT WORKS:  Think about how much you tip for a coffee- a meal- a haircut- or a live band playing at a bar. You donate however much you want. It goes into a pot and is divided among applicants who have been immediately impacted. Once it's divided up- it might not be a lot for them- but it's something.   HOW TO DONATE:  Donate through GoFundMe.   HOW SOON TO DONATE:  The campaign will run through Saturday- March 21st to ensure that workers can get their tips ASAP.   HOW TO APPLY FOR AID:  You must be an NYC resident who relies on tips to supplement your income. You must apply by Wednesday- March 18th to be considered.  Email the following to  tipsforkicksnyc@gmail.com  :  Proof of employment  A short description of the nature of your work  Your Venmo handle  All applicants will be notified whether they are approved through email.

   "description": "Join Austin's Asian community in saving lives by supplying local medical professionals with N95 masks.  The doctors- nurses and healthcare staff who are treating COVID19 patients need these supplies the most.  With our strong personal networks- we're able to immediately secure masks from certified manufacturers that can be shipped in a week.  100% of donations go directly to the purchase and delivery of N95 masks for frontline healthcare workers in Austin.   In Italy- 1 in every 10 Coronavirus cases are healthcare workers. The head of Italys medical association gave his life when he continued to see patients- even when masks ran out. We must not let what happened in Italy happen here in Austin.  While we recognize masks are needed everywhere- we're working to ensure that local businesses aren't left out of the picture. The more funding we secure now- the more masks we can quickly get into healthcare workers' hands.  Along with practicing your own health safety measures- now is your chance to directly save lives on the front lines. Even a donation of $3- the average price of just one mask- can save so many peoplewhat an incredible difference you can personally make. Please give generously today and share this campaign broadly with your networks.   FAQ    How will the funds be used?   100% of the funds go directly to facilitating the purchase and delivery of N95 masks. Our entire team volunteers their time and have foregone compensation for work. No one benefits financially in any way from this campaign. We're working to ensure that our suppliers give us the most competitive rates available for genuine medical-grade masks so that we can make sure that each dollar raised is maximized.   Why only Austin?   Were a team of Austinites and so we have established relationships with healthcare professionals locally.   Arent the hospitals   government ordering these masks directly?   Yes- they're trying their best to procure masks. However- due to supply chain limitations and global competition- they are currently experiencing extreme shortages. We are fortunate to have close relationships with many of the factories producing masks and will leverage these partnerships.   Ive seen other charity efforts related to COVID-19. How is this one different?   Ours is directly related to the supply of masks in Austin.   How much are you paying for the masks?   We are getting manufacturer pricing on the masks- but the approximate price hovers around $3 per mask. As pricing depends on order quantity- shipping rate (in this case- the faster the better to protect our healthcare workers)- and competing demand- the number may change. Were working to get the best possible price per unit while making sure that each manufacturer has the right certifications and approvals.   Are donations tax-deductible?   Currently- donations are not tax-deductible. We have realized that the need is so urgent that we must move forward and hope that you will donate.   I am a ER/ICU healthcare professional at an Austin facility currently treating COVID-19 patients. We are short on masks. How do we request masks?

   "title": "COVID19: Parents out of work & I'm chronically ill",
   "description": "If you prefer to donate through Paypal- I set up a family Paypal account under my mother:  paypal.me/huanglia   My background:   I am a university student with a chronic illness called arthritis- with no known cause and no cure. Otherwise known as autoimmune disease- chronic disability-or invisible disability. It is an immune system disease- therefore I am at high risk of dying from COVID-19 if I catch it.   My story:   I live with my parents and little brother. My family of 4 is a paycheck to paycheck family- with most of the money going toward my medical fees. Since the week of March 8- both of my parents have been dismissed from work- with no foreseeable future of going back anytime soon due to the coronavirus- lock-down- and no customers at their small place of employment. That means we do not have enough money coming into the family to sustain us past 1 more month.  The income from this past month and my leftover student loan is just enough for 1 month of rent. If we are lucky- our house owner may let us delay rent. If we are unlucky- we may be evicted- with the house owner using the loopholes in the current eviction laws- such as owner move-in. The owner already moved in upstairs. We are only renting part of the bottom half. It is stressful and scary to live without the security of a permanent place. Even if rent is delayed- we still have no source of income to pay all the debt that will pile up.  My parents are old- in their 50s/60s with no English skills. With the city on lock-down- it is hard to find a job that will hire them and not risk their health. With no work- my parents boss also suspended our family insurance that my parents bought through their work. The insurance took up 30% of my familys paycheck- with a high deductible around $9-000 - $12-000 USD. Now- we have no insurance- but I still have medical fees to pay. Arthritis is a chronic disease with daily medication and quarterly checkups. My aunt helped us look at other insurance options and with my parents income- it came out to $700 per person. That is $2800 for my family of 4. That is impossible for us to buy- let alone possible for just me. My parents paychecks do not even hit the $2000 mark. I am unsure what to do here. Last time when I had no insurance- my medication was ~$1625 for 3 months. With insurance- it came down to between $24 - $140.  I am a low-skilled- part time worker for one of the big corporations that is helping the world through this crisis at the moment with their large network. I receive zero benefits with my low position. There is a minimum amount of shifts I need to complete to stay hired- even during this crisis. My work has a lot of interactions with other people- and since I live in a hot-spot of COVID-19 outbreaks- I am afraid of going to work due to my non-existent immune system as described above. Even so- we need some money- so I signed up for a few shifts just to sustain us a little bit more. My parents are livid that Im going to work. But what choice do I have? We need to survive. We have bills to pay and medication that I cannot just stop taking or there will be a lash out in my arthritis symptoms and medicine side effects.   How your contribution will help:   Your contribution will go toward my familys monthly rent- followed by daily necessities such as food and water- and lastly- my medical insurance and medical bills.  Our main concern is rent for the next 2-3 months during this pandemic. We are looking at $2000/month in rent and utilities for 4 people. We live in an expensive city- but were renting in one of the poorest neighbors. Food- water- daily necessities- internet bill for online school- and medical fees will follow afterwards which is estimated to be about $700-900/month. However- since we do not have health insurance right now- that number can jump to $2000-3000/month depending on how much corporations want to charge my necessary medication.   What we are doing right now:   At the moment- we are filling out the EDD application for unemployment- but that will be a few weeks before it may be approved. I made this fundraiser in hopes of sustaining my family with emergency funds until we are able to stand back on our own two feet again. I do not expect this to be my sole source of income. I am already trying to sell any pre-own items from home through online platforms- but since we do not own anything fancy- it is a very low payout with a few dollars here and there.  My family has always been independent- especially my stubborn parents who shoulders all the financial and medical hardships on their own shoulders without asking for help from anyone or anything. They are the type who pays back grace with even more grace despite their own situation. This is the least I can do for them without them worrying to death about my health.   Thank you for reading and helping out my family. Stay safe everyone.",

   "description": "Hello Gamers Heaven Family. As you all know us and many other local and small business have been hit very hard by the effects of COVID-19. With the 2 week shut down and potentially longer- many business may end up closing due to this. Unfortunately we are not immune to this possibly either. The negative effects of this were being felt before the shut down- and may take months to return to normal even after the shut down period. This reality unfortunately places us at a very difficult position. We are currently aggressively looking for solutions- while working with our business partners- landlords- and suppliers to ensure that we keep the mission of Gamers Heaven pushing forward towards our ultimate goal.  I was very reserved about starting a Go Fund Me campaign but due to overwhelming support I have been receiving during this time and encouragement I have decided to put this campaign up. This campaign is about the 5 years of family and community that choose Gamers Heaven to be their local game store- their refuge and for some- their home.  Gamers Heaven has always been about putting the needs of the community first. We have always pushed to make the best possible space for all gamers- nerds and otaku alike. This mission has never changed and has been the main motivation behind all our decisions and changes. These decisions may not always have worked out- but we would not have grown to where we are today if it wasn't for all the trial and errors. For those that want to see a glimpse of what went into Gamers Heaven in the beginning- I kept video vlogs on  my old channel here.  If you are bored you can check them out as during the first few years I was able to record and edit videos. Lately between the workload at the store and taking care of my kids I have not been able to record or edit. I also encourage you to check out our old photos on our  facebook albums . Between the videos and photos- you will truly be able to see what we are talking about.  This campaign will be a mixture of the Gift Card profits- Donations- and the additional contributions from Friends and Family. I will also be updating the total based on whether or not we were able to procure assistance from outside sources as well. In terms of wages me and my team have decided to take as bare minimum as possible to help with costs. But below is breaking down what the proceeds from this campaign will be going towards so we are being as transparent as possible.   March Expenses:  March Rent - $7-550.00 March Utilities - $2-500.00 (Electric- Gas- Water- Sewage- Internet- and Trash Removal) March Wages - $3-600.00 (3 Managers Full Time at $7.50/hr) March Health Insurance - $1-500 (3 Managers and Families) March Business Insurance - $300.00 March Loan and Credit Obligations - $10-000.00   April Expenses:  April Rent - $7-550.00 April Utilities - $2-500.00 (Electric- Gas- Water- Sewage- Internet- and Trash Removal) April Wages - $3-600.00 (3 Managers Full Time at $7.50/hr) April Health Insurance: $1-500 (3 Managers and Families) April Business Insurance - $300.00 April Loan and Credit Obligations - $10-000.00  If you would like to purchase Gift Cards to contribute you can purchase them here .  As we don't know how long this recovery period will last- we are hoping to at least get caught up and give us more time to find additional solutions.  To give you perspective on how Gamers Heaven was doing- before COVID-19- we were growing enough to be completely debt free by the end of the Summer. We were able to maintain a core staff and cover our payments- and then was hoping to begin planning for Phase 3 after the summer- as we would've been able to start funding our next steps to continue to grow and better take care of our ever growing GH Family.  No matter what happens my family- my core staff and I will forever be grateful to all the people we have met along this journey and have become a part of our family- and most importantly to all those in the community that believed in what Gamers Heaven was trying to be. While we have sacrificed a lot- and have gone through many hurdles- you all have made this journey something that I will never regret making and hope that I can continue to show you guys even more.",

   "description": "Hello Friends-  I am Dr. Larry Farwell- a forensic neuroscientist- counterterrorism expert- and inventor of scientific and medical technology. My sister Dr. Jacqueline Farwell was a neurologist. She passed away last week.  Many people responded beautifully to my eulogy for Jacqueline. There I said- I suggest that the best way to honor Jacqueline is to carry on the torch she carried throughout her life as a doctor. Now we have a perfect opportunity to do exactly that.   Jacqueline died in hospice care with Evergreen Health- the original epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. I spoke with a nurse who had been a tremendous help to Jacqueline in her final days and an administrator there. She told me that with COVID-19 cases skyrocketing- they are already out of N95 masks- and soon will be short of many other medical supplies. These masks are crucial for preserving the lives of the medical personnel- so they can carry on their life-saving tasks for all of us.  I told her we can help. Due to the counterterrorism work I do- the overseas arenas in which I work- and the enemies I face- I have and use protective equipment  not only body armor- but also gas masks- hazmat suits- gloves- and even N95 masks. Now we are in the battle of our lives with an enemy that is no less deadly- harder to see- and closer to home than any in our lifetime.   I have access to all kinds of crucial medical equipment that is already in short supply. I offered to send some N95 masks that are different from the ones they use- and she said- Send what you can- and well be creative. I told her we can and will also come up with other needed medical equipment.  A few minutes later- on my next phone call- I discovered that some dear friends of mine are involved in making masks and obtaining other needed medical supplies. Here are links to the  Facebook group   Mask Drive - Help our first responders!  and the  website   Stop the Bug  . The one thing they lack is money and a mechanism to receive it.  I immediately reconfigured  Brain Fingerprinting Foundation - a Washington nonprofit set up to provide science and technology for determining the truth in legal cases- as  COVID-19 Emergency Medical Foundation . We will use 100% of donations to obtain the needed medical equipment and support our heroes on the front lines now- not later. In a comment Ill provide a list of needed equipment we will obtain as soon as you provide the funds.  The government and various well-meaning organizations are lumbering toward plans that may address the situation- to some degree- someday- in the hopefully-not-too-distant future. Our heroes on the front lines need life-saving N95 masks and other equipment now  in hours- not days- weeks- or months.  Now in Italy people are dying because the hospitals dont have sufficient life-saving equipment and must make triage choices as to who will live and who will die. My friends in the field say it is a matter of days before we are in the same situation here in our own back yard. Already nurses- doctors- and first responders are falling sick due to lack of protective equipment. You and I can help to keep them alive- healthy- and properly equipped so they can continue to save lives.   Donations will be through  COVID-19 Emergency Medical Foundation  /  Brain Fingerprinting Foundation - a Washington nonprofit corporation- Dr. Lawrence A. Farwell- President. Charitable Organization Registration Number 2003582 with Washington Secretary of State. (Note: this is not a 501(c)3 corporation- and donations are not tax deductible.)  Please give generously. The life you save may be your own- or a loved one  or a stranger no less precious.",

   "title": "Las Vegas Sex Worker COVID19 Emergency Relief Fund",
   "description": "ABOUT US  Email: lasvegasmutualaid@protonmail.com    COVID-19 in Las Vegas   As the response to COVID-19 calls for further self-isolation- sex workers are facing a severe loss in income and support networks. In Nevada- most of the Las Vegas Strip is shut down. All MGM and Wynn properties are closed alongside mass cancelations of normally scheduled conventions and events that sex workers rely on to pay their bills and live. Several local Las Vegas workers are experiencing extreme precarity and many are unsure how they are going to make rent next month or feed their kids.  Many sex workers who rely on in-person appointments are seeing in some cases a total loss of income with the tourism industry coming to a screeching halt. Workers hit the hardest are those already struggling to make ends meet. Black   Brown trans   queer workers- sex workers who are housing unstable- sex workers who are chronically ill or living with disabilities are all particularly at risk for negative impacts.  Some have been able to take up online work- others have had to continue working in increasingly dangerous labor conditions. We expect this to worsen as the pandemic spreads. Some sex workers may be forced to travel outside of Las Vegas and break quarantine in order to make money- making them more vulnerable to negative health outcomes.   The Fund    Solidarity. Not charity.   This is a no strings attached fund for sex workers in Las Vegas who are negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is currently monitored by two sex worker advocates in Las Vegas. Our aim is to provide as many one time micro-grants (ranging from $50-$200) that we can to sex workers in crisis.  There is also a possibility of providing long-term monthly or even weekly stipends- depending on the response to this initial mutual aid project.  In this time when many are in crisis we want to support our sex worker communities and leave no one behind. This fund is made up of 100% community donations and redistributed 100% to local sex workers. Every dollar really does count. If you can- please support sex workers in Las Vegas.  GUIDELINES  We are offering  one-time micro-grants on a sliding scale from $50-$200 . Funds can be used for cash support on rent and other bills. We can also use funds to assist you in purchasing medications- groceries- cleaning supplies- toiletries- transportation- etc.   How we select who receives funds   --  BIPOC/QTPOC- disabled- in-person- poor or low-income- drug using- street-based- and immuno-compromised workers are prioritized for micro-grants  but any sex worker active in Las Vegas is eligible to apply for this relief fund. -- Funding will be distributed primarily based on need- but we will consider the order of application as well. -- We are currently able to distribute funds via Venmo- Cashapp- or in person (within the greater Las Vegas metro area).  HOW TO APPLY FOR FUNDS  1. Email   lasvegasmutualaid@protonmail.com   and- 2. Answer the following questions with as much information as possible (we understand the sensitive nature of this information and will not save or use it beyond purposes of this fund): -- Are you a sex worker? -- Please describe what type of sex work you do. -- Are you Black- Indigenous- or a person of color? -- Do you identify as LGBTQI2SA+? -- Is your income being affected by loss of in person business due to COVID-19? -- Do you have other sources of income at this time? -- Do you have dependents? -- Do you have health conditions that put you at increased risk re: COVID-19? Do you have a compromised immune system? Do you have access to medical care? 3. Please indicate in your email  THE AMOUNT YOU ARE REQUESTING  and  WHEN YOU NEED IT BY .",

While the rest of the world figures out how to get face masks and respirators- we decided to tackle another issuehousing for healthcare workers. After a week of streaming movies and refreshing for virus updates- we wanted to do more to help. With Dean's healthcare background and Mike's fundraising background- we decided this would be the best fit for us to help out. The money raised will go to help alleviate lodging costs for healthcare workers.

   "description": "In 2018 I ran the Pittsburgh Marathon and achieved my dream of qualifying for the Boston Marathon.  I missed the cut-off by 90 seconds that year.  In 2019 I ran the Pittsburgh marathon to re-qualify for the Boston Marathon and made the cut to run Boston in 2020.     Due to COVID-19- Boston 2020 wont be held on April 20- 2020.     As someone who studies immunology and infectious diseases- I have come to realize that theres more to COVID-19 than just the symptoms and mortality rate. COVID-19 has incited fear and uncertainty for people across the globe- not just for the demographics that are most affected medically. The economic repercussions will impact those who are paid hourly and those without the benefit of sick leave.     So- Ive decided to make my own Not-Boston Marathon and run 26.2 miles on April 20- 2020. I want this to mean something more than just a race.      Im running to raise money for the Jean B. Purvis Community Health Clinic which is a free medical clinic that provides services for people who fall below the poverty line/are uninsured or underinsured in my hometown. This clinic is almost fully operated on a volunteer basis along with community donations. With many people unable to work due to COVID-19- individuals who rely on this clinic may feel the strain more than most.     I cant change the course of a global pandemic- but I can control my reaction to it. In times like this- the silver lining is important.     If youre still reading this- thank you. Any donations or words of encouragement are appreciated.

Due to fear and misinformation surrounding the Pandemic many people who need Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are not getting it.   PPE such as the  N95 Respirators  have been  sold out  across the world. According to the CDC the best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to wash your hands- don't touch your face- and cover your mouth and nose when coughing/sneezing.   Individuals who really need the mask are  health care providers  treating the sick and  those who have the virus!     I will be collecting new/unused N95 masks and raising money for shipping of the masks worldwide to hospitals and areas of confirmed cases. Please don't buy masks for yourself! Send them in so people who really need them can have them!   Please donate and help stop the spread.  *Shipping address to Follow*  Sources:   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/healthcare-supply-ppe.html#who-needs-ppe",

   "description": "National Homeless Collective Emergency Relief Fund  Our community is facing an unprecedented level of uncertainty and hazard In response to the rapid spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). People experiencing homelessness need our support now more than ever.  For the 24-000+ Victorians currently experiencing homelessness- these challenges are more complex and acute when coupled with high rates of immunodeficiency- malnutrition and a lack of access to support services. Especially for those sleeping rough. How do you self-isolate when youre experiencing homelessness? You cant. And with many essential front line services scaling back- the usual supplies of free meals and support wont be available soon.  The National Homeless Collective Emergency Relief Fund will support the immediate and ongoing supply- assembly- distribution of critical resources for Victorians experiencing homelessness through two existing initiatives: SLEEPING BAGS FOR HOMELESSNESS and BLACKPACK.  Were asking you to donate an hour of your wage as a suggested amount so these members of our community dont get left behind. As a 100% grassroots charity- we raise our money from fundraising activities like sausage sizzles and events. We can't do that now because of the restrictions on large gatherings. This means your online donations are more powerful and effective than ever. Without your donation- our work will have to stop. Its that simple.  Our SLEEPING BAGS FOR HOMELESSNESS project delivers thousands of brand new- high-quality- waterproof sleeping bags to people throughout the country. Designed based on feedback from people living on streets throughout Australia- and our BLACKPACKprovides immediate relief in the form of a backpack full of food- toiletries and essential sanitary items - offering someone dignity- choice and crucial support at the cost of just $5 per pack.  As a 100% grassroots charity- with our major sources of fundraising (i.e. sausage sizzles and events) currently not possible due to health concerns and restrictions on large gatherings- your online donations are more powerful and effective than ever. Without your donation- our work will have to stop. Its that simple.   Who are we?  Based in East Brunswick- National Homeless Collectiveis a First Nations run grassroots Australian charity that creates solutions to complex issues arising from homelessness- domestic violence- and social disadvantage. We achieve this by running six successful program that focus on and target a specific area of homelessness and disadvantage. We are five years in the running and have a proven record of breaking down barriers and supporting people directly- one on one.  We respectfully acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we work- and pay our respects to elders past- present and emerging. Sovereignty was never ceded and this was and always will be Aboriginal land.    FAQ  Is my donation tax deductible?  Yes! We are a registered national charity and have full DGR status which means youll be given a receipt for tax purposes as soon as you donate.  How much of my donation goes on administration costs and wages?  Zero. This fund is 100% used for the purposes we state. Buying sleeping bags- food- toiletries and essentials for people experiencing homelessness and extreme hardship. Like all modern day charities we do have admin costs and expenses however these are covered through grant funding only.  Can I come with you to hand out the sleeping bags?  If youre healthy and have the capacity to volunteer- contact us at www.nhcollective.org.au! We do regular street walks to give out the bags. Just get in touch and we can have a chat about what you can expect and what is involved.  Can I donate a blanket?  Yes! The Salvation Army and St. Vincent De Paul are happy to take them any time! We mainly look after people sleeping rough- and they tell us that blankets just dont work for them for very practical reasons as weight- bulk and waterproofing.  Can I offer a used sleeping bag?  Unfortunately- thats not possible during the Coronavirus outbreak for health and hygiene reasons.   Do you take clothing and shoes?  We usually do as we sell these in our Op Shop The Kala Space where we employ women experiencing homelessness- however due to current Coronavirus situation we have temporarily closed the shop.  Can my child volunteer?  Legally- our public liability insurance only covers those 15 years and over. Plus- we dont want children being further exposed to the virus.  Id like to know more  Sure! Head on over to our Facebook page or website www.nhcollective.org.au",

   "description": "At Park 734 Kitchen our kitchen manager- Kevin Inman- is making and distributing meals to quarantined senior disabled veterans in downtown San Diego.  Many senior disabled veterans already live on very meager means and depend on local non-profits for food. Because of all kinds of government agencies shutting down over COVID-19 lots of veterans will not have access to the prepared meals they once depended on before the pandemic.  Kevin is a senior disabled veteran himself and works as the kitchen manager at Park 734 Kitchen in East Village. Park 734 Kitchen is a commercial rental kitchen used by many of your favorite farmers market vendors- local bakers- small pop-ups- etc. to prepare their food.  www.park734kitchen.com .     When Kevin's apartment- which is filled with mostly senior disabled veterans- was put on a mandatory quarantine he knew he had to do something to help. So he decided to make good use of the late night hours available to him for free at the commercial rental kitchen he manages and make meals for his neighbors. All out of his own pocket.  What we need is either food donations from restaurants- cash donations so we can buy more food as well as a few more volunteers.  We are trying to raise $9000 as we plan to do this for the next 6 weeks in hopes that the shelter in place order will end by then. But we will continue on until things are back to normal. It costs us $3 a meal and right now we are supporting 60 veterans with one large meal 7 days a week. Therefore- we need about $1500 a week to afford all the food we need. There are no other expenses outside of the food- containers and cleaning supplies we are buying.                   Any additional funds that we raise that we do not put directly into the food for veterans will be donated to the Alpha Project.  www.alphaproject.com   Thank you so much for your support and prayers!

   "description": "For ios devices- please open with Safari. For desktops- please go to gofundme and search \"\"PPE Iowa\"\".   Protect our healthcare workers today�   Over the past few weeks- the rapidly developing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by novel Coronavirus has upended our lives in an unprecedented way. The number of confirmed cases in Iowa has been growing rapidly. Johnson County and eastern Iowa are especially hit hard by this pandemic. While many of us can take precautionary measures by working from home- healthcare workers- first responders- and urgent child care givers are at the frontline grappling with this pandemic. As they continue to work around the clock- the dire shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE such as masks and face shield) is putting their lives at risk. As reported in Patch- 10 of the first 44 COVID-19 cases in Philadelphia are healthcare workers.  We are members of Chinese Church of Iowa City and a group of Chinese American volunteers who live and work in Iowa. To protect our colleagues and friends working in frontline fighting COVID-19- we are asking your generous support for purchasing essential PPE for our doctors- nurses and many other first responders before these PPE run out soon. We have secured a few reliable medical suppliers in China. We have purchased the first batch of PPE including 6-000 surgical masks- 2-000 KN95 masks and 300 face shields- which will be donated to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and other healthcare providers in Iowa.   Our target is to raise $30-000. All of them will be used to purchase PPE for Iowas healthcare workers fighting COVID-19. Now it is time for us to come together to safeguard the safety and well-being of the community at large.   We are all in this- and we will get through this together. When we defeat this pandemic- kids will run freely in the parks again- friends will visit- hug and laugh with one another- and families will explore nature and cities. Lets act NOW and make an impact!

We will be supporting them with cash- rations   hygiene products as well as awareness on covid prevention.  During this time of need the most vulnerable- ones that don't have the luxury of work from home- daily wage earners and laid off workers without a source of income are affected the most. Donate generously to support our efforts to ensure their survival in these trying times.  Corona Solidarity Campaign is not a charity campaign - its a solidarity campaign. Its people of the city extending the solidarity to the workers who build our cities- who run our cities and our lives. This is a part of extending radical compassion in difficult times towards each other. We are doing this because we owe this to ourselves and humanity. This is not a charity- zakaat or sadqa. This is humanity and a political decision to stand together as people in times that the world is facing. Solidarity and empathy is the essence of humanity.  Just like the healthcare workers- the governments and the policy makers are doing their best- we as people are trying to fill in the gaps where we think we can.  We have created this gofundme page for anyone who is currently outside of Pakistan- and would like to contribute. In addition- contributions can also be made through paypal (Account email: qasim.99@gmail.com ) or venmo (@Qasim-Hasnain). Please mention corona solidarity campaign contribution when sending through paypal or venmo.

She leaves behind her three children- grandchildren- family and friends. Susana Garcia has been a resident of Delano- Ca since 2001. Where she was a strong business woman throughout the years in the community. Susana was loved by many family and friends of the community and was known for her cheerful and loving personality. She has battled a long journey throughout recent years- where she was hospitalized multiple times and had near death experience. Susie had triple bypass heart surgery- nearly lost her leg from a brown raucous spider bite- and has suffered multiple health conditions throughout the years. Susana Garcia fought every battle she was faced with by the grace of God.  Thank you in advance for your generosity! May God Bless you all.  This pandemic is so surreal- it is crucial to stay home and keep your social distance.   Miembros de la comunidad de Kern-  El 27 de Marzo- mi querida madre perdió su batalla a causa de la rápida epidemia de COVID-19. Ella deja a sus tres hijos- nietas- familiares y amigos. Susana García ha sido residente de Delano- Ca desde 2001. Donde fue una fuerte mujer de negocios a lo largo de los años en la comunidad. Susana era amada por muchos familiares y amigos de la comunidad y era conocida por su personalidad alegre y amorosa. Ella ha luchado un largo viaje en los últimos años- donde fue hospitalizada varias veces y tuvo una experiencia cercana a la muerte.

   "description": "Hi everyone!   COVID-19 has caused many universities to (partially) shut down. However- as an international and low-income student- I am only allowed to work on-campus and I have to rely on this income to pay for my rent- tuition- and other basic expenses. I was originally planning to work on-campus to earn some moving expenses and tuition since I will move to the east coast and start a full-time job there after graduation this summer.  As a graduate student and first-generation college student in my family- I have tried very hard to perform well in school and serve others. I am very excited to find a full-time job and will soon have a stable life in the US. However- as a result of COVID-19- I may not be able to work on-campus and have the money to pay for the tuition of this last semester- rent and all the other moving expenses. This is a particularly stressful time for me.  Thus- I am asking for your assistance to help me finish my last semester and relocate to start a full-time job in the east coast. Your consideration and help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your kindness and generosity.  Stay safe and I believe we will get through this crisis together!",

Our school is founded on equity as a fundamental core value. We are committed to ensuring that our scholars have equitable access to resources. Over 95% of our scholars represent the global majority- 75% of our scholars qualify for Free or Reduced Lunch- 20% of our scholars qualify for special education- and 12% of our scholars qualify for Transitional Bilingual services.  Our community has risen up against many hardships this year. We transitioned from Green Dot Public Schools- a Charter Managed Organization with centralized resources- to an independent charter school that is designed for and supported by the community. And now COVID-19. Through these challenges- our community has demonstrated strength- resilience- and love. We are proud of our scholars and our staff.  Amid the COVID-19 school closure- we are committed to the learning of our scholars by continuing their education through technology. As a small charter school- we are unable to access the same funding that traditional public schools receive. We are asking our friends- families- and community partners to join with us in raising funds to ensure all of our families have the necessary resources to support virtual learning. Please give any amount that is meaningful to you. Every dollar counts- and will help us to provide educational services (examples include: Chromebooks for scholars without computers- hotspots for families without internet access)- a safety net for families with unforeseen hardships- and unanticipated costs associated with this unprecedented closure. Please give today and share this with all your friends!  We are deeply grateful for your support! Thank you very much!

Negli ospedali  mancano   apparecchiature elettromedicali- ventilatori- farmaci e dispositivi di protezione per il personale  e non si riescono quindi ad aprire nuovi posti letto per la terapia intensiva (necessari- alla luce dell'aumento dei casi).

   "description": "Dear Oromo People and Friends-  As you are well aware- with the pandemic of COVID-19- we are said to be living in an unprecedented time in a human history. One that is challenging and threatening to the existence of humanity. With over 350-000 cases registered over 150 different countries and thousands of deaths to-date- we shouldnt lose sight of the devastating nature of this Virus. Ethiopia has already registered about 11 cases of the virus with- unfortunately- many more to be revealed in the future. We are worried about our people at the moment.  Yet again- more scary is the fact that a significant number of our people are living in a complete blackout with no chance of receiving and sharing information simply because the Ethiopian government continued to shutdown internet and phone service. Oromo people in Wallaga has now become the direct victim of this policy and as a result become most vulnerable to the virus. God forbid- but- if and when the virus reaches that part of the region- the consequence of the pandemic will likely register a tragic consequence.  Therefore- in order to prepare for such time- Kello Media decides to set up a task force that will proactively work to step in and up with the goal of filling the information gap created by the internet and phone blackout. We decided to:  1. Print half a million copies of flyers and brochures containing basic information about the prevention of COVID-19 to be distributed at public spaces in all of Wallaga.  2. Mobilize and cover basic transportation costs for volunteers to distribute the flyers to the public.  Kello Media is small start up organization which was established a few months ago by a group of young Oromo residing in Washington DC and in Finfinnee. We have now allocated small budget from our own locket to roll COVID-19 prevention campaign. But- we dont have enough budget to finance this particular initiative.  We are looking up to you to contribute whatever you can so that we will be able to distribute half a million flyers and brochures to our people living in an Information blackout who are in a dire need of information on how to prevent COVID-19.  Please- press the link below to contribute whatever you can. Gargaarsi keessan lubbuu saba keenya akka baraaruf waan arjoontaniif galatooma.

   "description": " Please share this gofundme with your friends. We need help   The \"\" Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) \"\" started in Wuhan and spread to the rest of China.  In Chengdu- Sichuan we didn't have many cases of the virus until recently. However now- the virus is spreading rapidly (over 450 confirmed cases) and Chengdu is now under almost complete lock-down by the Chinese authorities. It's the right thing to do- but it's causing massive problems.    By the time the virus lock-down was declared Chengdu stores had already been sold out of face masks- plastic suits and plastic gloves for many days . Now- by law- and enforced vigorously you can't leave your house without a mask- and you really shouldn't shop or do much else without plastic gloves or a plastic suit- but you just can't buy them anymore.   Workers can't work- companies can't open because only about 10% of workers are in Chengdu- the rest are stuck in their hometowns. Most stores aren't open. Without a mask you can't go anywhere. It's very bad for elderly people- they don't have the resources to help themselves.   I'm Canadian- and I've been living in Chengdu for about 4 years. I really love this city- and I want to help out. Because I'm a foreigner- many Chinese friends- and Chinese neighbors- and even people I've never met before but have seen walking around my complex have been asking me if I have a source for masks and virus prevention supplies. I didn't but I have found a supply in Hong Kong.   Masks and plastic suits are desperately needed in Chengdu- for medical workers- essential workers and everyday people. People are washing masks and reusing them because of the shortage. Many people just can't afford to buy masks or can't find them to buy even if they have money.   I have found a source of masks- plastic suits- and plastic gloves in Hong Kong- and I can find a way to get them to Chengdu. Good masks cost about $1 per mask- while plastic suits are $3-4. I can get a much better price per unit if I buy more.  My plan is to distribute the masks- plastic suits and plastic gloves to the poorer areas close to where I live (south Chengdu) and focus on the elderly- and people who need them the most. The more funds I can raise- the bigger area we can help. If we prevent even one person from getting infected that could prevent hundreds more later.   My estimate is that $1000 will buy enough supplies to protect an entire block for a month. Of course- more would be better. I'd love to raise more than that and expand the area and amount of time I can help. I do have friends who will help me distribute it- and our plans will be updated constantly depending on what's happening with the virus. I will also be cooperating with a couple of foreigner organizations here.   The COVID-19 virus is truly an epidemic already- especially in China. We need help immediately. Please help out by hitting the donate button. Every penny helps. If you can help out with $5- $10- $20- $100 it would be so appreciated by me- and by my Chinese neighbors.",

   "description": "Help keep a vital part of the community alive! Flamingos Coffee House needs your help.   Opening its doors to the local LGBTQ+ community and beyond in 2018- Flamingos Coffee House has been a vital part of the Leeds scene since- providing a safe space for local LGBTQ+ groups- raising money for charity and being a much needed dry space to spend time with friends and family in a welcoming environment.   We as a country are facing an unprecedented challenge in Covid-19 and we all have a responsibility to help keep those vulnerable to the virus safe. For James and the staff at Flamingos this means extra time spent deep cleaning and disinfecting- but for many customers it sadly means staying at home isolated from the illness. This means that Flamingos is in danger; takings have already dropped and are only set to drop further as more and more people are forced to self-isolate- work from home or even spend time in hospital.   Nobody wants to loose Flamingos as the meeting space- socialising space and stuffing-face-with-cake space so we want to raise money to cover the lost money so James can continue paying rent- bills- suppliers and- most importantly- his staff (who are on proper contracts - not nasty zero hours contracts) - themselves valued members of our community.   £10000 would not cover everything but would go a long way to allowing Flamingos survive this crisis and come out the other side live- kicking and ready to give back to the community as only they are capable of.   We will be regularly posting stories and quotes from its many customers and devotees expressing just how much this space means to them.",

   "description": "Coronavirus Help   'Escape the COVID-19' is a project under the guidance of Dhaka University Environment society engaging a good number of youngsters to fight against the coronavirus.  Fighting the corona virus (COVID-19) has now become the most crucial task for the world. Starting from China- this virus is spreading its deadly effects crossing all the borders and taking almost every country into its grip. Almost every developed country around the world is hard hit by COVID-19. Despite having strict rules and regulations- facilities and potentials the death toll is continuously rising in the developed countries. Italy- Spain- the USA are glittering examples.  Bangladesh is far behind from the developed countries in tackling the corona virus. Being the most densely populated country and having no systemic way of waste management- this country has higher chances to get affected badly. Besides the people are not taking any cautionary activities to fight against corona. Moreover due to lack of management and employment of rules- the stuffs to handle coronavirus like mask- hand sanitizer- gloves are getting out of market and becoming very costly. In the last 5 days- 8 coroner-affected persons were reported in Bangladesh. In the recent week about 94000 people returned to Bangladesh from various corona affected country( Source: www.prothomalo.com 16 march 2020) It wont take long to increase the number of corona affected patients and then it will become very tough for the Government of Bangladesh to handle the situation.  Our organization has been working with a view to creating awareness among the people on the slogan- \"\"Not panic- awareness is the main revenge\"\". We have a goal to give away masks- gloves- hand sanitizers and germ killing hexisol to 10000 people. Till now we have given some people these stuffs and raised awareness campaigns with our own fundings. But this source of funding is going to end soon. As a student we do not have endless source of income. We need the help of people from all over the world to reach our goal and help Bangladesh fight Coronavirus. Your donation will be highly appreciated and remembered.  Sources: 1.  https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/2020/03/08/iedcr-3-affected-with-coronavirus-in-bangladesh  2. The daily Prothom Alo  We are reviewing our primary steps to fight coronavirus. 1 / Mask distribution. 2 / Covid-19 test 3 / Distribution of medicine. 4/ Health awareness. 5/ Free Consultation. 6/ Online Article expansion.   In addition- we have taken initiatives to create awareness programs for teachers- students and parents in various schools. So we created a fund called Covid-19 Fund. We are looking forward for kind hearted people to help us saving lives.

We are so proud of our accomplishments and happy to serve our community and provide a safe haven for rescue cats. We also love providing a place of joy and happiness to the people in our community. While all small businesses face ups and downs- nothing could have prepared us for the COVID-19 Corona Virus pandemic. So far- our March sales are less than half of what they have been in prior months due to a dramatic drop in customer visits due to social distancing. We also face the real possibility of having to close our doors soon for an unknown duration of time. We fear it is the inevitable as the numbers rise in our area. It will become the only responsible option.   Unfortunately- when the doors close the bills still have to be paid. We also plan to keep our cats in foster care so we will still need to provide them with daily care. So far- the government is only offering small businesses access to loans. Loans are not the answer for us. We really cant afford to go into debt trying to survive this crisis. It would be difficult for us to recover. Thats why were asking for your support. Crowd funding allows a lot of people to donate small amounts that can add up and make a big impact. Together we can pull through and hopefully come out of this with minimal negative impact.  Your support means the world to us. We know that we couldnt have done anything weve done in the last year without the wonderful support of the people in our community. We also know many of you also face uncertainty during this difficult time and our thoughts and prayers are with you.  Weve set our fundraising goal at $12-000 to help cover the loss weve already faced- as well as preparing to cover our expenses for the next month. Thank you so much for your support!

   "description": "The TGNC Crisis Funding Circle Louisiana is a small group of trans individuals in Louisiana who are convening now to collect and disburse funds to trans and gender-nonconforming individuals who face increased financial hardship due to COVID-19.   Many trans Louisianans work in the service and tourism industry (among others that are impacted by the virus) and are facing lost wages- cut hours- layoffs- and more that threaten to make it impossible to provide for themselves the basic necessities. Because of discrimination- it will be harder for many trans Louisianans to find new work should they lose their jobs or need to find second jobs to get through this time.   Please donate to this mutual aid fund to support trans individuals facing these circumstances.   We are using GoFundMe rather than a traditional fundraising tool because it moves money faster than most other free fundraising tools.  Funds will be distributed as available on a weekly basis to trans and gnc individuals reaching out for assistance.   The fund is managed by Milan Nicole Sherry and Dylan Waguespack. The names of other members of the TGNC Crisis Funding Circle will be published here ASAP.",

In Missoula- we have created a COVID19 Community Organizing group- which aims to organize material support. Immediately we are providing grocery and supply deliveries. We are preparing to expand this to running errands- dog walking- childcare- caregiving- and mental/emotional support among people impacted by the pandemic. We are acting alongside those globally to show that our communities take care of each other and we also take care of ourselves. We cant allow greed to guide our actions. We need healing love and compassion for one another.   Lets be clear- this is solidarity- not charity. In the absence of larger structural changes- such efforts will not be nearly enough and could burn out the people involved. So we are also supporting workplace organizing efforts- demanding paid time off- quarantine pay- etc. We know that undocumented communities will be one of the most exposed groups with the least government support. Undocumented workers frequently experience abuse by their employers and may not report their needs for fear of reprisals. We will prioritize those most vulnerable.      Where will the money from this page go?  We are a collective of volunteers- not a non-profit. That means no overhead- every dollar is going towards groceries- supplies- and direct support.  Who are we?  We are regular folks in Missoula who have been active in organizing efforts and- more importantly- in community with each other. This is a result of love for community.",

   "title": "Long Island Laboring Against COVID-19",
   "description": "Hello everyone!    I hope you are staying healthy and safe during these extraordinarily challenging times.   My name is Sabrina- and Im a student at Syosset High School in Long Island- New York. Over the past week- Ive been mulling over how I- our Syosset schools- and surrounding communities can contribute in this battle against the Coronavirus. Thankfully- the Syosset Central School district- various student organizations- local community leaders- and the general public have already come together with generous support for this cause.      The Current Situation: Scarce Medical Resources     In light of theseverelyescalating Coronavirus pandemic in the US- particularlyin the NYC/LI region- we have healthcare workers from our direct communities at the frontlines of this battle- risking their lives to serve us and our loved ones. They're not only being exposed to the virus by fighting it- but are also  under increasingly dire circumstances due to severeshortages of medical masks- ventilators- intensive care units- and other essential equipment .    I created this GoFundMe to raise money for medical supplies for these frontline workers and to show our solidarity- appreciation- and support for the enormous sacrifices they are making to keep our communities safe and healthy.    During this critical time-  lack of resources has led many hospital employees to substitute essential medical masks  with bandanas and scarves- which are not as effective. Some doctors and nurses have had to make the conscious decision to risk their own lives to continue their jobs without proper equipment; they are our heroes and need our support NOW.      Stories from Our Community     There are several complications these frontline workers are currently dealing with. I read online about a doctor in the Bronx whoseco-residents had to transport a confirmed COVID-19 patient by themselves to the operating room without N95 masks because the ICU had run out of them. Another doctor- Dr. Irwin Redlener- director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University- received a phone call from a major Florida hospital which had run out of masks asking if it was possible to construct makeshift masks. Doctors in Seattle who are also forced to reuse N95 masks say they fear the lack of supplies will be deadly.     If people think that a hospital crisis is coming- its important to know that its already here - Redlener said. Its affecting front-line health workers- who are probably the highest risk group. These are like combat troops on the front lines of a war.   Doctors in America are facing acute issues because of the government's failure to protect them by adequately warning the public- providing tests- and supplying enough protective equipment. Emergency-room doctors are even more at risk. Every time a doctor falls ill- a health-care system already on the brink of collapse is further stretched thin.    These stories are all sobering reminders of the critical situation we are in- and shouldnt overwhelm us into inaction or apathy- but rather  spur us into mobilizing our resources and privileges  to help those in need.   With New York Citys virus progression approximately two weeks behind Italys- we must prioritize protecting our health care workers. China has used full body suits and better preventive techniques- and reports of infection amongst health care workers are closer to 3%.  American preventative practices- alarmingly- are far behind . It is frightening to imagine the consequences if we do not prioritize our health care providers. After all- without our doctors and nurses- what will we do?      Action Plan and Disbursement of Funds     In pursuit of transparency- and so that you can have full confidence in trust in this GoFundMe- we will be continually updating this page with updates. We have been in contact with local hospitals such as Syosset Hospital and Plainview Hospital. We are also currently in contact with a manufacturer of FDA approved N95 masks- who is already preparing a first order of 2-000 masks with money I have raised on my own through donations of family- friends- and personal funds all totaling around $3-450. However-  we need a lot more funds  to acquire more Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)- as the mayor of New York City has already announced that  hospitals will run out of PPE in 7 days.      We are racing against the clock  to provide adequate materials for those medical practitioners who are working tirelessly to keep us alive. Stand with us- and them- and help by donating to this cause and sharing this page with someone you know- so we can collectively raise money to help Long Island healthcare professionals purchase critical medical supplies that are running out even as I write this.      In Closing- an Encouragement     Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. Over the last few days- Ive been reminded time and time again that  in moments of crisis- humanity needs to unite and take a stand .    It is time to support and thank the health care workers of the Long Island and New York City area- where the contagion has proliferated more than anywhere else. To them we say- thank you for putting your and your familys lives on the line to fulfill your honorable duty. Thank you for relentlessly operating in perilous conditions to save everyone possible. The sacrifices youve made will not go unnoticed- and the thousands you save will be indebted to you for your service.   Together  we must continue to vouch for the safety of the medical community and raise awareness of this crisis . This virus will undoubtedly continue wreaking havoc on our city and the Long Island communities- but these workers are our great hope- who through their selfless sacrifice- are a literal lifeline to all of us.    Let us fight to help our community overcome this battle!     With Expectant Hope-   Sabrina Guo",

In a normal month- they feed 70-000 people including 25-000 kids. Since the COVID-19 crisis struck Manitoba- there has been a spike in the number of people who need food. Why?  Schools and daycares closed ending access to weekly meal programs for hungry kids. Also stopped Breakfast2Go weekend food for hungry kids. Businesses closed or reduced hours ending jobs or reducing wages for many and causing incredible stress for families already living cheque to cheque. Government assistance packages are not expected to flow until at least May- which means people will lose at least 3-4 pay cheques.  Coping with this pandemic is the greatest challenge we have ever faced. We need to come together as a community and get through this upheaval.   You can help right now by chipping in whatever you can!    Experts across the country are encouraging us to have a 14-day supply of foodenough to last the quarantine period if needed. Winnipeg Harvest is making large- pre-packaged hampers for distribution to families in need. The hampers will include standard non-perishable items like pasta- sauce- canned vegetables and meats- as well as baby food- formula- bread and other main food staples.   * Your gift of $25 will buy 10 lbs of food for a child or at-risk adult. * Your gift of $60 will buy one large hamper to feed a family of four. * Your gift of $250 will feed 4 families- one large hamper each.

   "description": "C chi ha reagito con scetticismo e chi sin da subito con responsabilit. Qualunque sia stata la nostra prima risposta alla diffusione del Covid-19 siamo tutti giunti davanti alla stessa incontestabile realt:  il virus è divenuto unemergenza.   Luniforme- in questa contemporanea battaglia- ha i colori bianco - rosso e viene indossata ogni giorno da  medici- infermieri e volontari della Croce Rossa Italiana . A loro viene chiesto di affrontare in prima linea lemergenza sanitaria ed è lì che sono- giorno dopo giorno.   E noi? E noi cosa possiamo fare dal tepore delle nostre case- che oggi sembrano a tutti un po troppo strette?  Noi possiamo decidere di indossare le nostre di uniformi e  scendere in campo . Possiamo far sentire il nostro supporto a chi sta in prima linea dando un piccolo o grande contributo per la Croce Rossa Italiana.   Indossate la vostra divisa e abbandonate lidea di non avere il potere di fare la differenza!   I fondi raccolti verranno utilizzati dallEnte Nazionale per acquistare ciò riterr necessario per fronteggiare lemergenza in tutta Italia.   Siamo in costante contatto con i Responsabili della Croce Rossa Italiana - Comitato Regionale Piemonte e si precisa che i fondi raccolti saranno devoluti direttamente allEnte Nazionale .   * * *   Some have reacted with skepticism and others with responsibility straight away.  Whatever your immediate reaction to the diffusion of Covid-19 was- we are now facing the same indisputable reality:  the virus has become an emergency.   In this contemporary battle- the uniform is white and red and is worn every day by  doctors- nurses and volunteers of the Italian Red Cross . Theyre asked to be on the front line of the battlefield and there they are- day after day.   And us? What can we do from the comfort of our homes- homes that today may feel a little too small?  We can choose to wear our uniforms and  take to the field too . We can support those who are in the front line with a small or large contribution to the Italian Red Cross.  Wear your uniform and ditch the belief that you have no power to make a difference!  All the funds raised will be used by the Italian Red Cross to buy the staff they need to face the emergency in the next weeks.  We are in constant touch with the Italian Red Cross - Regional Piedmont Committee and the funds we raise will be directly devolved to them.",

It takes place in Oakland- Ca. the last Saturday in April every year. This event stands as a beacon of joy and celebration and began as a direct result of mainstream ban on same-sex couples in competition.  Our goal WAS to raise $8-000 towards the costs of the event. However- since we have had to cancel our 2020 event due to COVID-19- we are now asking for your help to recover our losses. e.g. we are losing our $2000 deposit on our venue and we have spent a similarly large sum on publicity. We have no paid staff. We are all volunteer.  Your donation is tax deductible and with your help we will recover and be back bigger and better in 2021 (most likely April 24).  Thank you in advance for any contribution big or small that you can make to this cause that means so much to our community at large!   https://www.aprilfollies.com/   To glimpse the world of queer ballroom check out   https://www.hottotrotfilm.com/    All the competitors featured have competed in April Follies.

These individuals rely on gigs to pay their bills. For those who are dependent on another source of income to support their music careers- that secondary source is often hospitality/service industry. Another group hardest hit by COVID-19.  The Underground Online Music Series is giving performers a chance to do what they do best - share their music talent with the world. We hope to provide a sense of normalcy and a brief release for viewers and performers alike.  z2 Studios is hosting the music series featuring Milwaukee-area musicians. Since you cannot see them in person you will be able to enjoy their performances and donate to this fund to support these artists and give them a chance to pay for their rent- food- utilities- and medical needs.  100% of these funds will go to the musicians you see perform. Let's band together until our current situation takes a turn for the better. #theturn #weareinthistogether",

   "title": "Fund COVID19 Action by People with Chronic Illness",
   "description": "As we face the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and worldwide- we all are wondering how we will get through it- individually and collectively. And people with chronic illnesses need specific strategies.  I'll get to the point: I'm working with organizations and people across the country to launch a powerful national network of people with chronic illnesses.  We need your support- your wisdom- and your love -- and if possible- financial contributions.  I've spent most of my life being a part of game-changing HIV- LGBTQ and justice movements. I've founded deeply-effective organizations- coalitions and national networks. I've anchored teams of staff and volunteers- and held responsibilities for budgets and strategies from individual compassionate support to massive direct action.  I am honored to learn from and work with queer people of color who are the generative leaders of disability justice and healing justice movements with the power to transform our society so we all can thrive. I'm a longtime health care activist and journalist with multiple chronic illnesses. I focus on the intersection of health- care and medical systems; structures of power- information and control; and self-organizing networks to mobilize community wisdom and love.  So now -- working with national networks and brilliant organizers- healers and medical professionals -- I'm building a vital network of people living with chronic illnesses and our allies.  We may call it Chronic Illness Leadership For Emergent Times (CIVFET). But what's most important is what we're going to do:  --  We are hosting a video meeting on Saturday. Register at bit.ly/march7webinar (case-specific link).  (Thanks to AIDS United- Black Emotional and Mental Health collective (BEAM)- The Counter Narrative Project - Positive Women's Network-USA (PWN-USA)- ME Action for your co-sponsorship of the webinar.)  --  We've planned and initiated a rapidly-scalable plan for this network based on emergent strategies and mutual aid. We need your support to move forward as quickly and effectively as possible. As you know- people living with some chronic illnesses and disabilities are at greater risk of acquiring a coronavirus- having a more severe course of it and complications during or afterwards- and higher mortality rates.  And those facing oppression- marginalization and criminalization are most affected by heightened demands on health care systems and supply chains- economic turmoil- and rising stigma and bias.  (take a breath or a pause.)  But queer and trans people have always had to find new paths for our survival. Our strategies for dealing with chronic illnesses- like our communities themselves- are diverse- creative and take nothing for granted.  We are building a small but amazing team of network strategists- health professionals and healers- facilitators- fiscal managers- disaster response pros- project managers and tech experts- communicators and media producers.  Your support goes directly to this team -- which are primarily queer and trans people living with multiple chronic conditions.  Thank you.",

Currently- I enrolled at the University of Twente as a student. Due to the Covid19 outbreak- it is impossible for us (mostly students) to get a part-time job with tuition fee and house rent keep going. Therefore- I really need this support or at least a job to cover up the house rent. As I an international student (especially not from EAA)- it's already hard to find a job with so many criteria like speaking Dutch or another European language. My tuition fee is about 13-000 EUR/ year while the house rent is 300 EUR/ month.  Don't wanna be an optimist- but I do believe within months some good people will find the cure for Covid19 and world could go back to normal.",

   "title": "Pittsburgh Covid-19 LGBTQIA Emergency Relief Fund",
   "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the particular vulnerability of our LGBTQIA+ people- especially those of color. Due to our community disproportionately experiencing a lifelong arc of violence and discrimination- many of our community members are impoverished and housing unstable.  Many folks in our community are self-employed or in the service economy- living with disabilities- chronic illnesses- and/or compromised immune systems.  Realizing a need for mutual aid for our communities at this time- and inspired by Ijeoma Oluo's efforts to support her community of fellow artists in Seattle   Amita Swadhin organizer of CVOID-19 Relief Fund For LGBTQI+ BIPOC- Sisters PGH launched this fund on March 18th- 2020 and has since invited our trusted comrades Ciora Thomas- Aiden James Nevils- Aude Giglietti- Virginia Beck- Jim Depoe- Christina Acuna Castillo- to help manage the financial records and design and manage the process of fund distribution. We are all also open to other partnerships and relationships that would help this fund reach as many LGBTQIA people and organizations in Allegheny County as possible!!  We are prioritizing displaced LGBTQIA+ people because we have historically and currently faced increased barriers - including fewer ties to familial support networks- being simultaneously underserved and over-surveilled by welfare state systems- our needs have been surplus to mainstream political formations- and we tend to work in the gig economy (making us eligible to even receive unemployment.).  We recognize that the nation-state does not provide a safety net for so many people and that the United States governments response to COVID-19 has only deepened pre-existing hierarchies that make specific communities more vulnerable to premature death. We hope for a world in which universal basic income- universal health care- and other functioning social systems exist. We know that what we are doing is an imperfect solution to a very large problem- but we are trying anyway.  We talked with other mutual aid funds about how they decided to distribute the money they raised and decided that we wanted to absolutely avoid parsing through peoples narratives and deciding whose needs were more important than others. We agree with Adrienne Maree Brown who quotes Lao Tzu (author of Tao Te Ching) in Emergent Strategy: If you do not trust the people- they will become untrustworthy.  We are choosing to trust the people. We are not social workers and we refuse to replicate that position and dynamic. Most of the pool of people who have requested funds thus far are not employed full time- have a chronic illness or disability- and were already struggling prior to COVID-19 closures. Now our community is facing an even more urgent need- and we ask our community to respond.  The application to receive funds will go LIVE March 20th- 2020 and will stay open for as long as we are able to distribute funds to our communities- meaning- we will need as much support as possible to continue supporting our LGBTQIA communities of Allegheny County.  We will continue to update here and within the campaign of our progress as we move along.  Thank you for your support!    More information about sisTers PGH: SisTers PGH is a transLED- transgender community center- that provides supportive services- shelter and housing for the trans and non binary communities of Pittsburgh- PA. SisTers PGH- also offers outreach- trans inclusion training- advocacy- and People's Pride PGH while offering opportunities for our trans communities too thrive instead of survive.   A primary function of SisTers PGH is to amplify the voices of trans people within conversations around housing access- art- city/state leadership- mental health support- medical care- employment opportunities- and education..   We have learned via lived experience- that transgender leadership amplifies our ability to serve our communities in capacities that are truly effective and influential. In the words of Tarana Burke Victims know what they need; give them the resources to do it. Having Trans leaders provides a voice that can garner the creation of inclusionary change within cisgender dominant spaces.   SisTers Community Center functions as a safe and brave space for our trans and nonbinary community members of Pittsburgh. Those seeking daytime respite from homelessness and/or needing supportive services like food- clothing- toiletries- tutoring/GED Prep- Name Change services- employment- medical or mental health referrals- case management- housing- and rent/utility support.   Bimonthly Groups will also be held for the trans communities with topics that vary into mental health- safety- gender- sexual health- drug addiction- leadership- race- housing and healing- just to name a few.  www.sisterspgh.org",

   "title": "COVID19 Treatment Centre  Zimbabwe",
   "description": "COVID-19 has changed the world as we know it. Most countries are faced with a looming medical crisis- and have had to take drastic measures to flatten the curve- allowing for the health systems to cope with the increasing number of patients requiring emergency medical attention. As with everything- some countries are better prepared than others and some countries are grossly unprepared for the impending carnage that will take place if we sit back and do nothing. One of these countries- my land of birth- is Zimbabwe. Based on recent events- it is clear that as a country- Zimbabwe is not prepared to face the days ahead- and will need ALL of its people to unite to beat this looming disaster. The country depends on our solidarity now more than ever.  Zimbabwe needs a COVID-19 Medical Treatment Centre- YESTERDAY! What seemed absolutely ludicrous and unimaginable- was done - China built two COVID-19 specific hospitals in TEN DAYS. I am proposing we take a lesson from that and create a COVID-19 Medical Treatment Centre in Zimbabwe. The plan here would be to  rehabilitate  an existing PRIVATE medical facility or building that could allow for this. This could be running or non running. Realistically- construction of an entirely new medical facility- from the ground up- is not feasible from a cost and time perspective. The  rehabilitation  would include structural renovations to provision for as many ICU beds as we can spare- vital medical equipment and apparatus- procurement of drugs- PPE- testing kits and anything else required for operations  I do not have a project proposal- RFP- finalised building plans- contractors or details of land that can be used. I have consulted with a doctor based in Dubai who has shared with me rough blueprints of work they have done in the past to create Medical Centres for pandemics. These are below. I am appealing for assistance from anyone with this experience to assist with their skillsets. I am appealing to everyone- be it architects- land developers- construction companies- lawyers- bankers- trades people- nurses- doctors- cleaners- EVERYONE who can use their trade/skill to get this project to become a reality. While that is happening- the fundraising will continue- as time is of the essence here and we cannot afford to waste a second.     We are in the process of setting up and registering a charitable trust- domiciled in Zimbabwe- with clear and transparent TORs (terms of reference). As soon as this becomes available- these will be uploaded to this page for you reference. The TORs will include clear governance and accountability protocols- which should ensure all donors- that their contributions have been put to the intended and best use. The beneficiaries of the trust will be all COVID-19 patients in Zimbabwe- with NO discrimination of any basis as to who receives treatment- if capacity allows. The board of trustees is a carefully selected group of individuals- from a multitude of backgrounds- with strong experience in their fields.  As with all campaigns- potential donors want to know who is behind the campaign and the legitimacy of it. We have formed a team/task force to make this a reality. However I am the founder so a bit about who I am. My name is Langa Mlalazi and I am first and foremost- a Zimbabwean- born and raised. I know nothing about building medical centres or the healthcare system. I was born in Mbuya Nehanda hospital- a public hospital next to Parirenyatwa. As a baby- I remember it being a great experience- and a very clean hospital :). I currently live and work in the Netherlands.  LinkedIn   To conclude- Look to your hearts and the love for your nation and its people. Let us restore the pride we all share for that beautiful country- in the south of Africa. Even if we begin with 5 beds- that is 5 potential lives saved. That could be someone's mother- father- sister- daughter- son- brother- grandparent. A donation- no matter how small- can go a long way to getting us to this point.     thanks  Langa Mlalazi",

   "description": "We Are The World   Outreach To Find   Cure COVID-19  We are raising money to test our proposed cure (clo2) for the pandemic known as covid-19. We think we already have a cure- but it must be tested on the the actual virus. All procedes will be used towards this end. CLO2 is the chemical compound that has proven to be effective in killing many bacteria   virus infections. The FDA has approved its use for many things including mouthwash- but refuses to approve it for it's health benefits. It's so  inexpensive  to buy that companies cannot sell it and make money. Anyone can make it by combining to compounds which are available world-wide.  Our non-profit group is ready to go anywhere to test the clo2 cure for this pandemic. We just need the support   approval of the World Health Organization or the infected countries approval- to allow us to test it. Clo2 has been used for decades- but it's efficacy for medicine has never been proven- due to the millions of dollars required by the FDA - CDC for companies to mass produce it.  The History of Chlorine Dioxide ( CLO2  the proposed  cure  for COVID-19)   Chlorine Dioxide was discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1844. The British chemist combined potassium chlorite with sulphuric acid. It will soon be discovered that this green gas would be a more effective disinfectant than chlorine.   By the 1930's Chlorine Dioxide  was being used more frequently for disinfecting areas. Because of it's gaseous form- it filled spaces evenly. The volitile gas was impossible to ship safely- so Sodium Chlorite began to manufactured as a relatively safe precursor chemical- and the industries using chlorine dioxide would then generate the gas onsite as needed. Because of Chlorine Dioxide's solubility in water- it starts being used as a water treatment.   In 1944- Chlorine Dioxide  was used by the City of Niagra New York- to control odor and remove phenols from the river water used as the municipal supply to good effect. The city soon changes to Chlorine Dioxide exclusively. The water is cleaner- tastes better- and has no odor compared to the use of chlorine.   In 1956 Brussels Belgium makes the switch from Chlorine to Chlorine Dioxide  for it's municipal water system. It is discovered that Chlorine dioxide will destroy algae biofilm- a feat which Chlorine could not accomplish.   Through the 1960's  more cities and swimming pools start to change to  Chlorine Dioxide .   In 1967 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A) registered an aquaeous form of Chlorine Dioxide  to be used as a sanitizer and disinfectant. Chlorine DIoxide starts being used commercially on fruit and produce as a sanitizer.   In the 70's and 80's The EPA began reccomending Chlorine DIoxide  over Chlorine for water treatment and other applications. This was due to the fact that because of their different chemical properties- Chlorine Dioxide was more efficient- and did not produce toxic trihalomethanes like chlorine.   In 1988 the EPA registered Chlorine Dioxide  as a sterilizer approved for hospitals- laboratories- and healthcare facilities   In 2001 FEMA and other government agencies use Chlorine Dioxide  to to decontaminate buildings contaminated with Anthrax. Chlorine Dioxide was completely effective against the tiny Anthrax Spores. The buildings- walls and furnishings suffered no damage from the treatment.   In 2005 FEMA again uses Chlorine DIoxide . This time to eradicate mold from damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. A restuarant in New Orleans was able to re-open after being treated for just 12 hours without major repair.   The products- uses- and applications for Chlorine Dioxide  continue to grow. More and more mainstream health and home related products are using chlorine dioxide. There are several patents issued for companies to use Chlorine Dioxide to make personal and household products.   As of January 2020 the FDA- CDC- and other US organizations continue to forbid use of Chlorine Dioxide  as a medicine because of a lack of interest for corporations to make enough money to market it as such. Simpley said- the clo2 is so plentiful that anyone can make it. No company would ever be able to patent it. Therefore people die.  Will billions of people die now because it is too cheap for rich people to get richer? We suggest that one of the billionairs running for office donate clo2 to the world now!    WE ARE THE WORLD  (please save us)   FDA APPROVES CHLORINE DIOXIDE FOR WATER    FDA APPROVES CHLORINE DIOXCIDE AS FOOD ADDITVE    FDA APPROVES CHLORINE DIOXIDE FOR FOOD PREP    FDA APPROVAL LIST OF CHLORINE DIOXIDE USE",

   "title": "Andrew's COVID-19 Recovery",
   "description": "My son- Andrew Olivi- 33- native of the Beverly neighborhood of Chicago- IL- has been living in Wuhan- Hubei Province- China since 2009. After graduating from Augustana College- Andrew moved to China to teach English- and now works at Wuhan Britain-China International School (WHBC) as an AP Chemistry teacher. Andrew always had an adventurous spirit and he loved living in China and working with the students there.    When the COVID-19 outbreak first became apparent in Wuhan- we communicated with Andrew frequently during the quarantine. Andrew was isolated in his apartment with his beloved dog- Bilie. We were desperate for Andrew to get on an evacuation flight to the U.S. and he got a spot on the second plane due to leave on February 2nd. The day of the flight- I lost touch with Andrew for more than a few hours. Andrew was found unconscious on his bed and rescued by a neighbor. As many of his friends and family already know- Andrew also has Type I diabetes- so any bout of unconsciousness could also be related to diabetes complications. In the hospital- Andrew was diagnosed with COVID-19 and Diabetic Keto-acidosis and was in a state of unconsciousness for several days. I was out of my mind with worry- willing him to just at least open his eyes.    When Andrew finally woke up- he barely maintained consciousness and could not communicate. After another month in the hospital- he is starting to communicate slightly and can eat and walk again; however- the doctors have determined that at some point he had a stroke. Im in contact with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing- and they also spoke with Andrew and recognize that he is not all there and needs assistance. We do not know if Andrew will ever fully recover the ability to communicate with us- and due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions- we dont know when we will be able to get him home for rehabilitation. We have not been able to visit or help him- so Andrew has been relying entirely on his amazing roommate Sept for all of his basic needs until we're able to bring him home.    We know the whole world is now experiencing what Andrew and the people of Wuhan went through just a short month ago- but friends of Andrew have been asking us how they can help. Andrews initial hospital care wiped away his $20-000 savings. Our family has been contributing to his medical bills as much as we possibly can- but the financial burden is becoming more than we can handle at this point. We hope those interested will consider donating to Andrews GoFundMe to support his medical care during this crisis. We hope that one day in the coming months we can get him home and back on the path to recovery.",

   "description": " About 3 months ago - COVID-19 became the talk of the town.  About 3 weeks ago - our world stopped as social distancing became the new reality.  About 3 days ago - Mayor Eric Garcetti made an sudden announcement that all bars and restaurants will be closing in light of the new quarantine rules in Los Angeles effective immediately.  Bone Kettle is a small mom   pop establishment in the heart of Pasadena. We are entirely family run and independently funded. We employ 30 hard working- resilient- honest employees who live and breathe the service business and love what they do. They are mothers- fathers- uncles- grandmothers- brothers- sisters- friends- most of all they are intrinsic reasons why the business has sustained and thrived. All of our employees rely on the restaurant sales/income as their primary source of survival- so it's no surprise that when this announcement was made- it was a tough pill to swallow.  The day that the restaurant had to close indefinitely was one of the worst days of our lives and one of the saddest days of our lives as a business operator. It was truly heart breaking and hopeless. The worst part was the unknown and the potential implication of the closures to all involved. The one silver linings to this was the support of the community- incredible generosity through the transitions and kind outreach has been inspiring and deeply encouraging.  With that said- we were inspired to start this GoFundMe page to let our community know that we are still standing and you can help our invaluable service staff directly/show them your love. You too can be a part of the support that is desperately needed.  This fund will be 100% directed towards our service team and their families; your generosity will go very far in helping our service staff and kitchen workers sustain these grueling 2 months as we prepare for our reopening. Thank you so much for considering this support. We know that it's difficult for everyone at this time but we are so grateful for your support.   For any support greater than $100 - we will send you an official Bone Kettle \"\"Bone Appetite\"\" Tshirt of your size.   For any support greater than $500 - you and a guest will be invited to a dinner party hosted by Chef Erwin Tjahyadi and Chef Donna Famisan celebrating our re-opening. Plus 2 tshirts.   For any support greater than $1000 - you will get the above dinner party invite- tshirts- gift bag and we'll commemorate your gift with a framed photo of you/your family at Bone Kettle on our walls- as a permanent reminder of your generosity.   We would love your commitment by  March 31  as the need to support our team members is time sensitive. Thank you.        ",

Today I filed to start my own company- Genome Diagnostics. I will am seeking funding to provide free testing of Covid-19 at assisted living homes- schools and Doctor's offices. I am uniquely proficient at isolating genetic material from samples without the use of kits- which have delayed testing. I can obtain more RNA from a sample at a lower cost than the kits can. The funding provided in this campaign will go toward the purchase of a $4600 qRT-PCR instrument- an $800 freezer- and $1700 in reagents. Thank you for your assistance in helping fight this global crisis.",

   "description": " Humanitas University students are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Humanitas University to support the scientific research project on Coronavirus COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) conducted by Prof. Alberto Mantovani.  The donation will be used for the collection of samples from COVID-19 infected patients for future studies aimed at investigating the relevance of selected components of innate immunity in resistance to the infection and in the pathogenesis of the disease.   In addition- the prognostic potential of original molecules developed by Humanitas University will be investigated in order to rapidly identify severe cases and adopt adequate therapeutic approaches.   *  Please also see below for our message and the translations in Italian- Turkish- French- Spanish- Greek- Swahili- Chinese and Norwegian.  *  Hello everyone from Italy.  We wanted to reach out to you- as medical students of the Humanitas University- regarding our concerns about the corona virus outbreak.  We are currently very thankful to our university for handling the crisis in an assuring manner- by taking the early precautions to let us continue our education through online streaming without an interruption- and this only increases the level of responsibility we feel even further about the situation that we are in.  We believe that all the people in the world who are in the field are doing their best- and as future doctors we are continuously studying to know more about the virus- reading all the new articles as they come by and support our professors and scientists while they are giving their full attention to the actual work in the lab. This is because a breakthrough in science rarely takes place as a result of a certain individual entity's effort. It almost always reached through the ongoing accumulation of knowledge and contribution of several different sources at the same time.   As human beings- we are all earthers; so it's a natural reflex to react to such a misfortune global situation like this. In addition- as we are medical students based in Italy- where the biggest acute impact is felt at this time- our concerns and urge to take action is quite amplified.  We feel and accept this pressure altogether- and that is why we already launched a specific research project to understand the mechanisms of the virus right here in the research center of our university- yet we cannot do this alone if we'd like to beat our opponent in a timely manner. This is the third time that we are facing an infection caused by a member of corona virus family and if we want it to be the last one- we have to act altogether- we have to act strong and we have to act \"\"at once\"\".  That is why we come up with this project- \"\"Cure for Corona\"\"- and we invite you all to support this local effort which will naturally contribute to the global cause as we go by.  Our university's research efforts in establishing a further understanding in the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of corona virus family is conducted by Prof. Alberto Mantovani- who is arguably the best mind in the field of Immunology and the reason we want to stress this point further is that each and every contribution of yours- which will naturally make you part of this cause- will be channeled to the exact need at once by people who are excelled in the field.  Last but not the least- we'd like to reiterate that this project is an initiation of the students of the Humanitas University in order to assist our common goal of supporting our community- city- country and world at this difficult time.",

   "title": "COVID-19 Relief for Homeless Communities",
   "description": "Homelessness is inherently a public health crisis- and as COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe- there is a dire need to insure that people who are forced to live on the streets have the necessary resources to protect themselves and others. Homeless people are some of the most vulnerable to infection and without proper support from city and state governments- many are left without the basic means to prevent contamination. Due to these circumstances- we must take it upon ourselves as neighbors- activists- and community members to provide material assistance to the homeless.  The United Front Against Displacement- a homeless rights advocacy organization composed of housed and unhoused activists- has launched this GoFundMe campaign to support the Wood Street Community during the COVID-19 outbreak. Located in West Oakland- the Wood Street Community is composed of approximately 250 people who live in RVs- trailers- tents- or other hand made structures. This community has long been neglected by the City of Oakland- which has failed to provide basic resources such as porto potties- hand washing stations- or dumpsters for the residents of Wood Street. In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak- there are no signs of the city offering to provide residents with resources such as masks or hand sanitizer- which have been deemed crucial for preventing the spread of the virus. Many residents also do not have the means to self-isolate as recommended due to the social nature of living conditions and the fact that many residents need to come and go for work and other important activities. These conditions put residents at extreme risk of general health issues and- more specifically- of contracting the COVID-19 virus.  The COVID-19 virus has spread rapidly throughout the globe with confirmed cases on the rise. Worldwide there are now over 150-000 confirmed cases with 5-735 deaths. In the state of California alone there are now officially 511 confirmed cases and in the Bay Area in particular there are 272 cases confirmed with San Francisco confirming 37 cases- Santa Clara 114- and Alameda County 11. Due to a lack of testing and an overall inefficient response to the outbreak from the state- these numbers are low. It is likely that in Oakland alone there are hundreds of cases and throughout the Bay Area thousands. With homeless people being the most vulnerable to the expanding spread of the virus- it is crucial to offer material support.  While these conditions paint a grim picture it must not be lost that through collective effort we can make sure that people are better prepared to overcome this crisis. The funds donated to this campaign will go towards providing resources for residents of the Wood Street Community such as masks- hand sanitizer- and materials to waterproof and renovate the structures that people live in. Wood Street residents are greatly appreciative of material support and we can assure you that the money you donate will be put to the best use possible!  Thank you so much for your contributions!

   "description": "Die Covid19-Pandemie hat auch uns vom  THEATER DER KLNGE  getroffen. Mitten in der Probenphase für unsere neue Produktion müssen wir unseren Betrieb einstellen- weil das Risiko für unser Ensemble- sich gegenseitig zu infizieren- einfach zu gro ist. Trotzdem haben all unsere Tänzer- Video- und Tonkünstler aber auch unser Regisseur und unsere Choreographin Verträge- die ihnen Lohn versprechen. Und das zurecht! Unsere Künstler sind nämlich oft freie Mitarbeiter- die nur von Engagement zu Engagement bezahlt werden und jetzt besonders stark getroffen werden. Daher reit uns unser Probenausfall momentan ein Loch von ca. 5.000  in unsere Kalkulation.  Als freies Theater sind wir sehr von öffentlicher Förderung abhängig. In über 32 Jahren- die wir jetzt bestehen- sind wir von verschiedenen Institutionen regelmäig grozügig für unsere einzigartige künstlerische Arbeit gefördert worden. Doch die aktuelle Lage konnte niemand vorhersehen und auch nicht einkalkulieren.   Doch wir geben nicht auf!   Wir könnten jetzt einfach warten und versuchen- uns etwas von den staatlichen Notfallfonds zu sichern- die in Aussicht gestellt wurden- doch wir wollen aus dieser Situation lieber etwas gutes machen: Wir haben uns dazu entschlossen- solange der Lockdown weiter anhält- wöchentlich einen unser Vorstellungsmittschnitte unser bislang 27 Produktionen online für ein Wochenende zu veröffentlichen.  Jeden Donnerstag Abend um 19:00 Uhr veröffentlichen wir auf unserer Homepage eines unserer Stücke in chronologischer Reihenfolge. Diese Stücke sind zum Teil seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr gespielt worden und die dazugehörigen professionell gemachten Filme lagern seitdem in unserem Archiv.       Sie wollen Kultur und können diese momentan nicht erreichen?  Wir verstehen die aktuelle Lage gut und sehen mit Bedauern- dass Kultur das Erste war- was man gestrichen hat. Aber wenn Sie bislang gerne in Theater- oder Tanzvorstellungen gegangen sind- dann werden wir Sie begeistern!  Auf unserer Website  haben wir ausführliche Informationen zu all unseren bisherigen Produktionen veröffentlicht- damit Sie sich einen Eindruck machen können- was wir bislang geschaffen haben. Die Stücke im einzelnen sind:  1.  Die mechanische Bauhausbühne  (1987) 2.  Die barocke Maskenbühne  (1988/89) 3.  Die Küche  nach Arnold Wesker (1990) 4.  November 1918 * 1989  (1991) 5.  Figur uns Klang im Raum  (1993) 6.  Reden ist Silber...  (1994) 7.  Ludus Danielis  (1994) 8.  Die Vögel  nach Aristophanes (1996) 9.  Jubiläum  (1997) 10.  Die Neuberin  (1999)  11.  Das Opfer  nach Igor Strawinsky (1999) 12.  Megalopolis (2001) 13.  Modul|a|t|o|r (2002) 14.  Gregorius auf dem Stein  nach Hartmann von Aue und Thomas Mann (2004) 15.  HOEReographien  (2005) 16.  Teufels Kreise  (2006) 17.  Ich  ist ein anderer  (2007) 18.  Johnnys Jihad  von Marc Pommerening (2009) 19.  Suite Intermediale  (2011) 20.  Vanitas  (2012)  21.  Coda   Bachs Cellosuite in c-moll (2014) 22.  TRIAS  das triadische Ballett  nach Oskar Schlemmer (2015) 23.  Kontraste (2016) 24.  Die Kunst der Tanz-Fuge (2017) 25.  Bauhaus Ballette  (2017) 26.  Der Silberprinz : Neun Blicke auf Walter Gropius (2018) 27.  Das Lackballett  nach Oskar Schlemmer (2019)       Warum Spenden?  Zugegeben- wenn wir die Filme doch eh jede Woche hochladen- wo liegt da für Sie der Anreiz zu spenden? Nun- der liegt in zwei Aspekten. Zum Einen helfen Sie uns wirklich weiter- denn wir können die Spenden im Moment gut gebrauchen! Als eingetragener Verein können wir Ihnen auch gerne eine Spendenquittung ausstellen. Zum Anderen haben wir uns noch ein kleines Dankeschön überlegt: für jede Spende  über 50   geben wir Ihnen vorab den Vimeo-Link zu einem in dieser Woche nicht veröffentlichten Mitschnitt. Sie können sich dann gerne so oft Sie wollen eine unserer 27 Produktionen ansehen und zwar vollkommen losgelöst von unserem Online-Premieren-Zeitplan.  Sie können also auch während des Lockdowns virtuelles Theater von zuhause genieen!   Organisatorisches  Als freies Theater leben wir von Zuschauern- die unsere Vorstellungen sehen kommen. Daher behalten wir uns vor- die Aktion mit den kostenfreien Filmen zu beenden- wenn sich die Lage entspannt und ein normaler Kulturbetrieb wieder möglich ist. Auch im Falle- dass die Aktion auf kein Interesse stöt- behalten wir uns vor- sie frühzeitig zu beenden. Im Fall von Problemen mit der bermittlung von eMail-Adressen zum Erhalt von Vimeo-Links- nehmen Sie bitte über das Kontaktformular Kontakt mit uns auf. Wir werden uns dann versuchen- so schnell wie möglich darum zu kümmern. Auch bei weiteren Fragen stehen wir gerne über das Kontaktformular zur Verfügung.",

   "description": "This is a fundraising initiative to pursue the creation ofa COVID-19 Vaccine by Dr. Wilfred Jefferies and his team.   Dr. Wilfred Jefferies is a Professor in the Michael Smith Laboratories and a Senior Research Scientist in the Vancouver Prostate Centre at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Jefferies is working towards creating and testing a safe and effective vaccine for the novel coronavirus- COVID-19. His approach is explained here:    https://globalnews.ca/video/6622294/ubc-research-teams-work-on-high-performance-covid-19-vaccine    In January 2020- a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan- China and has since spread to at least 89 countries and territories around the world.Small-molecule anti-viral therapies targeting different stages of the corona virus lifecycle may beeffective in treating COVID-19- however- in the absence of an effective vaccine- the probability of containment is low and the world must beprepared for a pandemic. Therefore- the rapiddevelopment of protective vaccines against COVID-19 has become a societal priority but remains a scientific challenge. The ideal COVID-19 vaccine would elicit highly potent neutralizing antibody responses against a broad spectrum of emerging COVID-19 viral strains; induce protection against infection and transmission; and be safe by not inducing any harmful immune or inflammatory responses. These are particular challenges in vaccination against viruses such as COVID-19. This funding initiative builds upon groundbreaking research by Dr. Jefferies and his team on vaccines against Rubella- West Nile Virus- Smallpox- Influenza- and Cancers and seeks to create and test a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for rapid implementation.  The Sullivan Urology Foundation supports Dr Jefferies in his work at UBC and the Vancouver Prostate Centre and is partnering with this GoFundMe in support of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. The Sullivan Urology Foundation provides financial support to the Department of Urologic Sciences at the University of British Columbia for basic scientific translational and clinical research.   http://www.urologyfoundation.ca/",

   "title": "Washington Youth for Masks: COVID-19 Support Fund",
   "description": "WHY DONATE   The Washington State Nurses Association (WSNA)- which represents nearly 20-000 workers- said its hearing from concerned members-- nurses being told to reuse papers masks- being instructed to not wear masks unless there is a confirmed coronavirus case and being told to re-use face shields without guidance on proper cleaning. ( read source here )  Hospitals in Washington state are running out of personal protective equipment (PPE) as healthcare workers fight against COVID-19 to save lives while protecting their own. Many medical professionals are instructed to reuse their masks throughout the day- and some are having to turn to scarves and bandanas as hospital facilities run out of PPE ( read source here  ). This is pushing our states healthcare system to the limits. Already- we are incurring significant unplanned expenses in order to respond to this crisis- and it is likely that the top of the bell curve in this outbreak is still yet to come.  We are holding this fundraising campaign in order to secure medical masks quickly- and are grateful to have connections to the Well Klein factory- alongside other reputable- FDA approved factories in China. We cannot solely rely on state and federal agencies to distribute masks- as time is critical. Instead- we have the ability to get these supplies to our healthcare workers within 5-7 days.  The overwhelming advocacy from other adults within our community who have stepped up and raised funds has deeply touched and inspired us- and any sum of donation will aid in helping health professionals protect themselves while risking their own. As our community has been so deeply affected from this devastating outbreak- we want to take steps in garnering community support to help in any possible way.   GOAL   The first $25-000 will be committed to obtaining ~50-000 FDA approved medical grade surgical masks from Well Klein factory in China to be distributed across four different hospitals (depending on changing international flight costs).  For every $5-000 raised- we will purchase ~10-000 masks- and so on.  Any additional funds raised will be used towards purchasing additional masks for other medical facilities and first responders across King County.  *If unforeseen circumstances arise and international shipping is blocked anytime in the future- we will ensure that all donations go to domestic orders of the masks.   HOSPITALS     1. Harborview Medical Center - Seattle 2. UW Medical Center - Seattle 3. EvergreenHealth Medical Center - Kirkland 4. Swedish Hospital - Issaquah   ACCOUNTABILITY   We will post continual updates and pictures of the masks collected on our  Facebook page  in order to ensure that 100% of the donation goes to purchasing masks.   OUR STORY   We are four high school students from the city of Issaquah. Since the start of this outbreak- we have been deeply concerned with the severity of this pandemic. Our extended families have been living in this crisis in China- Korea- and India- giving us a personal understanding of the effects of this pervasive worldwide pandemic. As the situation with COVID-19 became increasingly detrimental- schools closed as did other public facilities. Soon after- close friends and family who work in hospitals have been sharing the alarming news of PPE shortage. As the outbreak separates our community in a trying time- we want to encourage unity and togetherness to battle the divisions that this pandemic has caused.   WHO WE ARE   Angelina Chin is a junior at Issaquah High School. She works closely with UW Medicine and is committed to promoting health in both local and global communities. Having established multiple philanthropic relationships- locally and internationally- to benefit fundraising efforts- she has created campaigns to advocate for head   neck cancer research and a youth initiative at UW Medicine to improve the health and well-being of Asian and Asian-American communities. Her work has been recognized by many organizations- including the Seattle Seahawks- Safeway- and AccelerateMed. She is also deeply involved with the Issaquah Highlands Chinese Heritage Club- where members have connections to overseas manufacturers and have been actively donating bulk orders of masks to local clinics and hospitals.   Isha Rudramurthy is a junior at Issaquah High School. Having worked with non-profit organization Asha Seattle and its youth chapter Junior Asha- she has been involved in numerous community and international efforts to bring about change in South Asia. In a time of desperate need within her own heavily impacted community- she hopes to make an impact through her work.   Faith Lee is a senior at Issaquah High School and an incoming freshman at the University of Washington. As an aspiring nurse- she has worked with the UW Medicine staff as a volunteer and has a passion in providing care to patients. With stories and news from close friends directly involved in the hospitals as health professionals- she wishes to provide support to all by sharing our story and advocating for unity in this time of devastation.   Claire Kang is a senior at Issaquah High School and an incoming freshman at Yale University hoping to study computer science or biomedical engineering. She has worked at Harborview Medical Center in downtown Seattle- studying public health and researching the general populations knowledge- attitude- and beliefs towards bleeding emergencies in partnership with the national Stop the Bleed campaign. With the goals of improving both the access and quality of healthcare- she has volunteered at numerous hospital facilities- such as UW Medical Center- and the Issaquah Swedish Emergency Department. First-handedly witnessing the impacts of PPE shortage- she hopes to support the doctors and nurses who are working hard for her community.   FAQ    How much of the donation is directed to purchasing the masks?   100% of the funds will go towards the purchase and delivery of masks for healthcare workers at Harborview Medical Center- UW Medical Center- EvergreenHealth Medical Center of Kirkland- and Swedish Hospital of Issaquah. Our work is completely volunteer-based and grows with community support. If we raise more than $25-000- we will continue to purchase and distribute masks to other hospitals.   How do we know the money we donate will go towards acquiring masks for hospitals?   We will post frequent updates on our  Facebook page  with photos with receipts.   How will the hospitals receive the masks?   The masks will be delivered to one designated house- and we will personally ensure delivery to the hospitals mentioned above.   What makes this fundraising campaign different from other fundraisers?   With a general misconception that this COVID-19 pandemic only impacts the immunocompromised and the elderly- we want to reinforce that everyone- even the youth- is susceptible to this virus. Despite the numerous cases of older people covered in the media- anyone of any age can contract and spread this deadly disease. Many young people remain willfully ignorant of these consequences- refusing to sacrifice their day-to-day social interactions with the belief that the issue is not as severe for them. Along with helping collect materials that will directly support victims and doctors- we hope to spread awareness to other youth about the risks to their health and their key role in stopping the spread. In addition- our connections with the Well Klein Factory- alongside other overseas and domestic factories- will ensure faster delivery of masks.   How else can I help?   Even without money donations- there are other ways you can help in this time of crisis. If you have unopened and unexpired supplies such as hand sanitizer- surgical gloves- face shields- and masks- please donate them to accepting hospitals such as UW Medicine and multiple Swedish locations. You do not need to leave your vehicle- as staff will pick up the items to ensure your safety.  - Please spread the word! Sharing this GoFundMe page AND our  Facebook page will be greatly appreciated.  - Contact us through email:  wayouthformasks@gmail.com   - If you share our goals and would like to join the #WaYouthforMasks team- please contact us through our email.

   "description": "With the swiftness of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the West Coast- the situation is changing very quickly. Cities are recommending curtailing all events. Office workers are working from home- major cultural institutions are shutting down.  Here are a few things that I believe: * this is the largest public health crisis in generations. * in San Francisco and Seattle we already should be self-isolating (this is  the recommendation of the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management ) * it is important for the good of our community that we  slow down the spread of the virus  * it is important  to act immediately  * not all concerts/performances have been canceled yet  With this fundraiser I intend to support performing artists (i.e. musicians- dancers- actors) whose livelihoods have been disrupted by the outbreak- as well as positively encourage artists to take a role leading by example- encouraging people to stay home and self-isolate.  Basic outline: * I will run this fundraiser from March 10 to March 31 * At the end of that time- I will divide the funds amongst the artists in proportion to their losses * I will set a maximum of $10-000 for calculating the proportionality- however if in enough funds are raised- artists will be reimbursed in full for their losses * If- by any chance- more funds are raised than artists need- I will refund the difference to funders. * I'll be transparent in my accounting- and show where the funds have gone.   To apply for relief- contact me via GoFundMe. You must: * Be a performer whose shows on the US West Coast between 3/1/2020 and 6/1/2020 have been cancelled (by you- or by the promoter/venue/institution) due to COVID-19. * Provide documentation of those cancelled shows- along with whatever documentation you can about expected income- as well as any cancellation fees etc. incurred due to cancelling the show   Disclaimer: None of these funds will go to me- however it may support musicians I work with as a producer.

   "description": "A few years ago- I raised money to help kids across our state by eliminating their school lunch debt. I took action because I saw a need. Collectively- I knew we could do something about it. And we did: We wiped out lunch debt in schools across the state of Minnesota.  Today- were facing a bigger challenge. The coronavirus is hitting Washington hard. Unfortunately- 29 people have died and 366 people have tested positive- according to the Health. Government officials warn it could reach 64-000 in a few months if our leaders do not take the steps necessary to stop the spread of the virus.  We hope and encourage our government officials to do all they can to test- treat- and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.  People need immediate help. During this crisis- those with the least suffer the most. Some folks cant go to the doctor because they dont have healthcare. Public schools are closed for at least two weeks and some people cant afford to take off work because they dont have paid sick leave. Some parents have to choose between paying the rent and feeding their kids.  This will get worse before it gets better. But the good news is that theres a path forward.  You may wonder- like I have- if theres anything we can do to help. We dont have to sit idly by waiting for someone else to solve the problem. We can take action. We need to come together and lift up the folks that need a helping hand.  I recently read about the Minnesota Foundations COVID-19 Response Fund. The Seattle Foundation is an important organization providing direct relief to those that need it most. They will provide money to residents without health insurance and/or access to sick days- people with limited English language proficiency- healthcare and gig economy workers- and communities of color- among others. The Fund is working closely with King Countys Pandemic Community Advisory Group to identify organizations currently providing or receiving requests for support and will use the money raised on our campaign to assist with these efforts.  I will not have access to the funds. Every dollar donated will be transferred directly to the Minnesota Foundation. Your donation is tax-deductible.  Please join me in becoming part of the solution. Donate $5- $10- or $25 bucks. Every contribution counts. Let your voice be heard and let the people know that we have their backs.",

   "description": "  The sick- now also the dead.    A disturbing silenceoutside the cemetery of Bergamo lays waste to life. Yesterday evening- ten army vehicles set off for Modena and Bologna- loaded with the corpses of those whose stories are no more- those a devil named COVID19- imprisoned to a lonesome death.  Sixty-five corpses left the city of Bergamo- where Pope Giovanni XXIII- the hospital that in a couple of weeks transformed its intensive care into Europe's largest- is on its knees- having been long drawn over its breaking point.There are no longer any places even in the last corners converted into COVID treatment zones. Patients are transferred wherever an equipped facility becomes available- if it does become available: 15 non-serious patients have been moved to rest homes- 2 intubated to San Raffaele and Como- not to mention the latest departures. The hospital is currently out of intensive care beds.The Papa Giovanni XXIII said all its 80 IC beds- reserved for people in serious condition with the coronavirus- were full.  What happens when there is no more space and more patients needing treatment come in? Drastic choices have to be made. The type of choices that predict who is most likely to survive and who is most likely not- the type of choices that necessitate the valuation of one life over another- the type of choices that will abandon many to their fates if not taken care of. Note that this is not a remark against medical institutions. They are doing an extraordinary work and we can all say we are extremely proud of them. However- they are forced into a situation where they have to chose who to save and who to leave.  I am personally angered by some people which seem to be relieved that these deaths are for a large part the elderly- giving them some sort of reassurance that they will be fine. The first thing they do is go find a statistic that somewhat tells them \"\"it's good- won't hurt me probably\"\". The kind of people that it's not a problem until its their problem. The kind of people that dispose of human life with not too much regard.  But let me ask you this- did the elderly not protect us when we were not strong enough to stand ourselves? Did they not feed us when we were hungry? Did they not hold our hands to the park and play with us when we were kids ? Did they not parent us when some of us had no parents to care for us ? Did they not read us those bedtime stories when we were scared that the monsters in the dark would come out to get us ? They did all those things and they did even more.  Now- the monsters in the dark are coming out to get them - but we're not the small defenceless kids we once were. We are strong men and women who can and will fight these demons off. I want you to think of those you love- those moments you shared with them and what you are willing to do to protect them. Seat your asses on the sofa- donate and be responsible.       I am inviting you to the protection of life- no matter who it is. Their lives do not deserve to be gambled on- and we ought to fiercely defend them with the same love they shielded us before we were ready to stand on our own two feet. Let's get more beds so that we can treat ALL people. This hospital is carrying a burden far greater than it is abilities- and is in dire need of help. Please donate.  The money will go to the hospital of ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII- situated in Bergamo (Lombardia). Their IBAN isIT52Z0569611100000012000X95 (check to see if you have any doubts concerning this funding)   The funds raised will be used to purchase:   - Ventilators  - IC Beds - Non-invasive ventilation devices  - Hemodynamic monitoring - Disposable scrub hats- gowns and glasses   Thank you for your time-  Davide Cognigni",

   "description": "My name is Emily Reynolds- I'm an undergraduate at Alaska Pacific University (APU). As many people know most colleges are shutting down due to COVID-19 concerns. APU- like many other colleges- are shutting down campus and sending everyone \"\"home\"\" by March 20th. This displacement has become a huge issue within the APU community- because many students are going to be homeless- cannot afford to fly home- or end up back in a toxic living situation. Many students are also losing their income because they work on-campus jobs. My goal is to raise money to help out as many peers as possible this includes- assisting with paying for rent- food- storage- moving expenses- flights or any other essential necessities. If you cannot afford to give money at this time please do not stress- because information is just as valuable. Information about cheap apartments/rooms available and anything else that may help. If there are any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to reach out.",

   "description": "Hobart Pastor Jeff Spencer of New Hope Missionary Baptist Church in Hobart on Route 6 announced his wife tested positive for COVID-19 last evening after receiving a call from the hospital with test results. Spencer as a result was put on two week quarantine as well.   Spencer through social media has been telling this story over the last week on his personal Facebook page which began early last week when she started feeling ill. She had gone to the doctor on Thursday and was released till her condition started to get worse according to Spencer. Spencer said her blood oxygen levels were dropping along with a high fever and trouble breathing when she was brought back in. They brought her back to a local hospital only to have her admitted and put in ICU. The hospital immediately isolated the patient and did the Covid-19 test instead of waiting for Tuesday. Their assumptions were true when the test results came back Monday night. Currently Spencers wife is on a ventilator and sedated in isolation at a local hospital.     Spencer wanted everyone in the area to take this very serious and the news is not an exaggeration of any kind. Spencer said- I want you to know it can effect you because it has me. Should you take caution while out in public- most definitely. But the most important thing you can do is pray and ask God to intervene. He hopes the people they were in contact with do not become sick and if they are feeling symptoms to isolate themselves.",

To ensure that we can sustain the viability of the company through this crisis- the owners had to make the very tough decision to temporarily layoff more than 80% of our staff- which they intend to re-hire as soon as we can reopen. While the company generously offered to pay the wages for all hours and classes scheduled through the end of March- we know now that this crisis will last for weeks beyond that- and state unemployment benefits will not come close to fully replacing their income.  Many of you have generously asked what you can do to help. We are not asking for nor do we expect donations- but we also realize that many of you have personal relationships with our team- so if you are feeling generous and would like to support your coaches and staff- you can make a donation to our GoFundMe page.   No donations will go to the company. All donations will go directly to the 18 laid-off employees and be split equally between them and dispersed out every 2 weeks.  Any gift- however big or small- will make a meaningful impact to your studio teams during this unusual time of need. We promise to return the generosity in the days ahead- in our way- when we can.  Thank you for your continued support. We miss you all so much!",

Some of these children count on these meals. Our goal is to help bring non-perishable food items to the doorsteps of these families.

These same volunteers will deliver the items to the families in need that send us a request for aid. We are creating a flyer and posting it on social media platforms. We are really focusing on trying to bring aid to those without transportation and have no way of getting to the provided school provided lunches. We are also looking to share this same aid with the homeless population. We are looking to provide these services to some of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the metroplex. We are starting with Oakcliff. If we gain enough support and donations we would love to expand out efforts to as many neighborhoods in need as possible. Any donations would be much appreciated.

Many children in Clark County as I am sure in other areas as well depend on school breakfast and lunch as their only source of meals for the day. Clark County currently has set 15 locations where children are to pick-up their meals. The problem is a lot of the children will not be able to walk to the pick-up locations listed. A lot of families are also being laid off due to the casino closures and we are anticipating a need in our community.  Unfortunately- because of Covid-19 healthy meal preparations will not be possible with such little time.

We are passionate about the lactation and doula services we provide and the classes and support groups we facilitate. But at the end of the day- we are a start-up business. We just celebrated 6 months of being open to the public and every month we barely make ends meet to cover rent- utilities and overhead costs. We (Emily + Danielle) do not take home a salary but rely on the money we can make through our private services to support our families.  With the outbreak of Covid-19- our fragile business is floundering. We strive to bring people together and with social distancing and fear of the pandemic on families' minds- our groups and classes have taken a huge hit. We maxed out our credit getting our space built out and off the ground- and were only just beginning to pay down our loans when the virus hit. We are unsure of how much more this business can take in this unsustainable direction. We desperately want Fern + Foster to exist- but we need help over the next few months to survive. As we cancel classes we strive to treat our teachers fairly and pay them their lost wages.   We are too small to get government help- and not big enough for unemployment to take effect.  We serve anywhere from 30-120 people per month through our calendar of events. Many of our groups and classes are unique and fill needs in our community that no other organization does.  So we turn to you. We know the power that community can hold and the importance of asking when you need something. Can you help us meet our goal to cover our costs over the next 3 months? Please consider donating to our GoFundMe or  purchasing a gift card for use on future services ! We would love to share some love in return and send you a thank you gift.

   "description": "The COVID-19 Crisis is affecting the entire world right now- which means that there are multiple communities from all over the world who are at risk of different problems. Here at the University of Oklahoma- international students are a particularly vulnerable community.   Many students rely on employment and its income for their needs- paying their tuition or affording healthcare. Those students currently have reduced work hours and cannot afford basic necessities- and in many cases- may have to spend more money for unanticipated summer housing or travel costs.  There are 2-155 international students at OU from 135 different countries- all with different border restrictions caused by COVID-19. Based on initial survey data- we have found that multiple students are in dire need of money for everything from medication to housing to groceries.  Thus- we are starting with a 5-000 USD goal. It might seem like a lot- but a lot of students are facing immediate situations and troubles with wide ranges.  We urgently ask for your help. This campaign will remain open to receive donations- so please continue donating and sharing to the best of your ability! Everything will go to help international students!    The International Advisory Committee (IAC) is an international student organization (ISO) that serves as the umbrella for all other ISOs. We are student run and are advised by the College of International Studies. We advocate for international students on campus and the international community as a whole. We also bring different events to OU- including International Bazaar- International Prom- Human Library- International Pageant and the sadly cancelled Eve of Nations due to COVID-19 fears .",

   "description": "Over the last week- all of us at Centerline Movement have been weighing our options for action during this coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.  As small business owners- we have a responsibility to act in support of the greater societal good. In this crucial moment- that means doing everything we can to flatten the curve of this pandemic. The time to act is now. In response...Centerline Movement will temporarily close our physical doors.  We want tokeep our community- and the greater Tucson andsouthern Arizona communities- at the lowest possible risk of exposure and spread.It is our hope that by temporarily closing now- we're making a choice that is abundantly care-full- and one that will allow us to possibly reopen in 2 to 3 weeks. We also understand that it could be 1 to 3months.  This decision carries many heavy concerns.  The primary one- for the purposes of this page- is for the well-being of our incredible group of 11 Centerline movement educators- all of whom are self-employed business owners working as independent contractors. They work their passion and depend on classes and client sessions for their very livelihood. It's part of Centerline's philosophy to pay our educators well- at rates 1.5 times above the Southern Arizona average. Yet- as independent contractors- they work without the conventional safety nets- like:  - paid sick leave  - paid time off - access to employer-provided and employer-supplemented health insurance - unemployment benefits - protection under the FMLA and FLSA - employer share of payroll taxes (ICs pay both employer and employee payroll tax)  If it resonates to support our movement educators- and if it's possible for your budget- please contribute. 100% of monies raised will go directly to Centerline independent contractor relief.  I cannot thank each of you enough rallying to support our team as we do what we can to limit the spread of COVID-19. To read more about how we're committing to caring for the larger Centerline community- click  here . Please do reach out with questions- concerns- and requests. It's important to us to hear from you!",

   "description": " It is time for all of us to unite together and join the fight against covid19.    MASK FOR AMERICA  Project Highlight:  -  Hospitals in the US are running out of medical supplies  such as face masks- cover gowns- and other personal protective equipment (PPE) due to a nationwide shortage caused by the Coronavirus outbreak.  -  Doctors and nurses who fight against Covid19 at the frontline are desperately need our help!   -  We are asking you to join the fight together  with our medical workers- help them get those PPE they need- to keep them safe- healthy and well-protected.  -  MASK FOR AMERICA is a donation-based program - all your donations are going directly to the sourcing and distribution of masks and other PPE for US hospitals and clinics. Were asking for your help in supporting this cause.  -  We hope to distribute throughout the US as more funds come in.  We are based in Chicago- IL and will start by providing PPE to Chicagoland hospitals and clinics.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Our Goal   Commitment    With this project- we are looking to procure as many N95 and surgical masks as we can for donations. Our goal is to protect the health of as many healthcare workers across Illinois and the US as possible. If we are going to stop this virus in its tracks- we will need our brave healthcare professionals in good health.  If we hit our initial goal of $40-000- we will be able to purchase approximately ten thousand each N95 masks and surgical masks from the vetted suppliers and ship them to hospitals treating COVID19 patients.  We are committed to donating the equipment we acquire through this initiative to hospitals and doctors that need them most urgently. We plan to make our first donations to hospitals in Chicago starting with  University of Illinois Hospital.   If you or someone you know works for a hospital/clinic that treats COVID19 related patients and is in need of PPE- please have them fill the form below so we can arrange our donations.    https://forms.gle/9KJ8TfQqTqWaiKsw9    Please keep check back in with us as we make progress towards our goal.   Why are we doing this?   When I first moved to the United States- people often asked me how I like it here. I always share my opinion about I love the strong sense of community that US people have. I always wanted to be part of it and show my gratitude to my community by being helpful.  When the coronavirus outbreak first started in China- there was a huge shortage of medical supplies in almost every hospital. As someone who paid close attention to the matter- I quickly contacted my friend Lizaa in China and helped finding medical resources. We spent several weeks trying to source available PPE from overseas to help in Chinas fight against the coronavirus- after weeks of effort- Lizaa told me that finally the local supply started to catch up with demand.  Unfortunately- one month later- and now the virus has spread across the whole world.  Over the past few days- Ive come in touch with several people in healthcare that indicated urgent need for personal protective equipment.  I first saw my neighbor who is an ICU nurse posting on NextDoor to urge people to please stay home. She emphasized that we desperately need to slow things down- because hospitals are already becoming overwhelmed.  Another friend of ours- a wife and mom- works as an ER nurse and her hospital is running very low on masks and they do not know what to do.  I knew I have to do something to help my community. I keep asking myself besides quarantining myself at home- what else can I do? How can we help? And then it occurred to me that we may be able to find PPE supply from China to bring back to the US. Sure enough- our friend who has helped Chinese hospitals acquire these items locally has introduced us to the suppliers. These masks are produced by FDA-approved suppliers and are willing to sell them at a reasonable price. (This is very important- because many of the available masks for public use are not properly vetted or certified and some of their price is just crazy.) Upon making this connection- we felt it was our responsibility to open this channel- but we cant do it alone.  I view our situation like a war against coronavirus- and our healthcare providers are fighting at the frontline- day and night. The rest of us need to join them and fight together against the virus. We cant treat patients- but there are still lots of things we can do to help and to contribute- to get ourselves involved- to tell doctors and nurses- you are not alone- we are in this together! That is why I am starting the project Mask For America.  These are tough times for everyone as business has slowed down and- in some cases- stopped altogether. For those of you who are able- we greatly appreciate any contributions you make to this effort.   How Can You Help?   As China ramped up its fight against COVID-19- national mask production also increased tremendously. At this moment- US mask production has not yet caught up with demand. We have identified manufacturers in China with surplus of N95 and surgical masks as well as other PPE- but no way to distribute them where they are most needed currently (here in the US). For the cost of a cup of Starbucks coffee- we will be able to protect a medical care provider a whole day. Literally no donation is too small! Thank you all for your contribution!   FAQ    What is the current situation in IL?   Like much of the nation- testing is just ramping up here in Illinois. Already hospitals are expressing concern with shortages of proper PPE such as masks and gloves. As of March 22- there are 1-050 confirmed cases in Illinois including 298 new cases- over nearly 150 more new cases than reported on March 21. We should expect for confirmed cases to continue increasing as testing becomes more widely available. This means the supply of PPE is only going to become more stressed over the coming weeks.  \"\" Hospitals all over the state are in jeopardy of potentially running out of critically needed protective medical supplies-\"\" IHHSA President A.J. Wilhelmi said. \"\"With continuing uncertainties about global and U.S. supplies of face masks- we urgently need to find alternative supplies- no matter where they are- so our hospitals can continue to provide life-saving care to current and future COVID-19 patients.\"\"  We desperately need to slow things down. The medical system in our region is markedly stressed by seasonal viral infections in real time and area hospitals are already seeing multiple COVID19 cases  ICU nurse in Lincoln Square posted on Nextdoor- 17th March 2020   Where are all the masks?   As the healthcare system strainsto accommodate the unprecedented challenge of the coronavirus outbreak- many medical professionals on the front lines do not have adequate protection. Some are reusing masks and gloves. Others have taken to social media with public pleas for help using the hashtag #GetMePPE- an acronym for personal protective equipment. Without proper covering- every new bedside visit might prove fatal- especially for older physicians and their families. And already- dozens of health care workers across the country have fallen ill. Hundreds more have been forced into quarantine.  The sky is falling- one doctor wrote in an opinion piece for  The New York Times.   Were heading into the abyss- wrote another.  The short supply of masks in particular is dire.",

While our world-class clinic remains open and serving patients- telehealth is key to prevent overload of health system resources while minimizing transmission to both health workers and patients. The US Centre for Disease Control has recommended the use of telemedicine as a response to COVID-19 to limit exposure. China too- moved 50% of its healthcare online shortly after the outbreak.   Praava Health has already rolled out  FREE COVID19 telehealth screenings to our 40-000 patients . In this difficult time- we want to be able to screen as many people as possible. This funding could help us reach an additional 100-000 patients per month- and convert our call center into a 24 hour call center (we currently serve patients from 8am to 10pm every day).   Every $100 donated provides 25 telehealth screenings.   Every $500 donated provides 125 telehealth screenings.   Every $1-000 donated provides 250 telehealth screenings.   ---    Praava Health  is a vertically integrated family health system in Dhaka- Bangladesh. We are powered by international standard doctors- diagnostics- and technology- with a world-class clinic and 6 laboratories established according to international standards- including Bangladeshs first molecular cancer diagnostics (PCR) lab.

   "title": "Struggling Freelance Artist in COVID19 Crisis",
   "description": "Hi everyone-  First off- thank you so much for taking the time to read my story. My name is Hayley- 24 from Los Angeles- CA. I am a freelancer i.e modeling and content creator. For almost 2 years now full time- I have made my lively hood from modeling and being an influencer. The road definitely has its ups and downs- but Ive always managed to make it up until recent.   In the middle of December 2019- my roommate held me hostage for a series of 5 days which lead to her attempting to physically harm and attack me multiple times and her posting on social media about how she was planning on  murdering  me. After countless police filings due to said harassment and assaults- I filed for eviction and restraining order and had to give her her rent and utilities money back for the month to get her to evacuate the property which cost me my entire savings account with all the legal paper work involved.   After multiple bad roommate placements- early January I took this as a sign to finally start my small business (a home recording studio) something I was planning on doing for a while- but didnt think was possible. After help from a friend and completely maxing out all my credit cards over their limits- I invested literally everything I had and launched my small business the middle of February! By the end of February- I started expressing strep throat like symptoms which overnight became drastically different with fever- chills- and I could not get out of bed. From February 18th till March 14th I was in and out of the hospital being misdiagnosed and not medicated properly. March 14th it was declared that I had Bronchitis that was turning into pneumonia.   (A little before the COVID outbreak) I closed my home recording studio business during this time (two weeks after its opening) and had to cancel all modeling work because my unknown sickness. In that time- in order to get money for medical bills- I took out the only loan my banks would let me take out which didnt even cover all the medical costs or help me get by on bills. By the time I was properly diagnosed- COVID19 was announced a pandemic and my inhalers and medications that cost me $5 with insurance now cost me $110 with insurance and that day I had to walk away without filling my prescriptions.   During this time I started noticing cancelations left and right and by March 13th my entire 8 weeks of bookings were canceled with all my businesses and I had already been out of work for 3 weeks between all my businesses whether it was modeling- content creating- and the home recording studio.   Due to the nature of my business(s)- lack of proof and past tax records - I have spent countless hours online and talking to government employees to be told I do not quality for EDD and/or any current financial assistance. I do not have parents and I do not have family members I can turn to for financial help- I rely on myself 100% for income. Even with the rent and utilities freeze in California- I wont be able to pay back almost 3 months of past due bills. Because I have no proof of income or anyone to co-sign me for things like apartments or loans and being on a month to month lease- if I get evicted after the freeze- I run the risk of losing everything I worked for these past years- my dog baby- and not being able to move into a new home if so. I have never asked for anyone for help like this in my life and it pains me to do it now- but that is the humility of the human experience we have to grow and learn through and I am truly relying on the kindness of humans right now.     What this money would be used towards   Rent Medication Prescription Dog food/supplies Food/Water/Toiletries Car Payment      Personal offering:  I am offering 30 minute angel/energy readings for anyone who donates $30+ please just send a screenshot to my email at  management@hayleyherms.com   3   Overall- I appreciate any help I may receive whether its $1 or $100. I know there are a lot of freelancers and their families like myself out there in the same boat and we are all very deserving of help. Thank you and I am so grateful to anyone who donates and/or just reads my story in advanced. Sending so much love to everyone!",

   "description": "A few of us created this fundraiser as a way to help keep us afloat during the COVID-19 threat. We are a small group of people whose primary incomes come from self employment- art- music- and persons whose livelihoods depend on crowds attending events.  As you know- events are cancelled daily- people can't leave town- and large gatherings are no longer permitted because of COVID-19. We are on sinking ships and we want to stay afloat so we can continue being assets within the Wilmington community. Wilmington is only beginning to feel the fallout from COVID -19 and many of us already are suffering financial hardship beyond our control due to COVID-19. That is why we are asking for your financial support. We are usually on the frontlines helping others when disaster strikes. Your support will ensure our productivity.  Without art shows- service jobs- and other events- this niche in the community is in danger of coming to an end.   We are the forgotten ones- the ones who aren't included in stimulus bills or don't qualify for other financial assistance.  If you love Wilmington's art scene or use the other services provided by community entrepreneurs and select service industry professionals- please consider pitching in to our relief fund if you have the resources. Thank you for helping us hang onto our homes and for giving us the opportunity to keep our heads above water.  We appreciate your donations!",

   "description": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected 71-334 people worldwide. 1-775 people are now known to have died from the virus. Six health workers have died and 1-716 have been infected since the outbreak. In Wuhan- where the virus was first detected- 242 people died on the 13th February alone.    As a group of academics at  Cardiff University - we are in solidarity with our fellow collaborators in Hubei Cancer Hospital in Wuhan  who are working against the clock in fighting the coronavirus and saving lives. We particularly wish to support our Chinese colleagues by funding protective equipment for frontline medical staff due to their critical shortage of medical resources. These individuals are working tirelessly to protect us- so it is vital that we protect them.     Before the outbreak- Hubei Cancer Hospital was supporting us on various projects including early cancer diagnostics using circulating biomarkers and evaluation of cancer immunotherapy effectiveness. We had two PhD students working in Wuhan since November 2019 on these collaborative projects.    In view of the increasing number of coronavirus infected patients in Wuhan after the initial outbreak- Hubei Cancer Hospital started to provide healthcare service to severely infected cases and reported their critical shortage of protective equipment.    All the donations will go solely to purchase NIOSH-certified N95 respirators and other protective equipment for medical staff in Hubei Cancer Hospital. We hope more patients can receive effective treatment when adequate protective equipment is in place for medical staff. The control of the coronavirus in Wuhan is important to stop further transmission to the other countries.       The fundraising team of academics in Cardiff University aim to acquire the medical equipment using the fund and send it to Hubei Cancer Hospital by March 2020. At the end of the fundraising- we will circulate a report of the use of the fund to all contributors.  We are grateful for your support.   Let's battle the coronavirus together!

   "description": "Nine years ago- while taking my daughter sledding- I happened to see a For Rent sign in the window of a neon green art deco building. Within 5 hours we had signed a 3 year lease for what is now Modern Times. In the decade since- I hadnt imagined a time I would be asking our community for help.   I started Modern Times with the money I made selling a bike shop I owned and operated outside of Olympia- Washington; I profited $30-000. With that money we remodeled the space; bought used equipment from all over Minnesota; asked friends to build booths and paint; and made the space usable. The week before we opened I borrowed $4-000 to buy food. We worked with our community to open this restaurant. Our only desire was for customers to keep coming back to eat- snack- be with each other- and drink coffee.   I consider myself a soft-capitalist: I am so grateful for every customer who has made the choice to eat at Modern Times or buy merchandise; youve kept our doors open. I feel immense luck for that walk with my daughter 9 years ago. That chance sighting led to signing a lease and a decade of work. From day one we have been busy enough to pay ourselves and our employees. Beyond that- this past year I had the privilege of buying the building through a Deed to Trust. We have worked hard throughout these years to make Modern Times a place that is unique: offering a hippie/freak/pedestrian diner vibe whilst serving organic and local products- prioritizing food made for a variety of dietary preferences (vegan- vegetarian- carnivore). I strive earnestly to offer a dining experience that is disappearing as our city changes.   This was all before COVID-19. Last night- March 15th- we learned of several positive virus carriers in our neighborhood; both cases working within the retail or service industry. With this information we made the fretful decision to close. This highly contagious virus is already in our community and I could no longer- in good conscious- ensure we could keep our staff and customers safe. This morning we handed out our perishable foods to our staff and neighborhood. I will continue to do this as long as possible and/or necessary.   Today I learned that Modern Times insurance will not cover any closure costs or lost wages due to COVOID-19. Our 19 employees will be filing for unemployment; a decision I encouraged- but know will not be enough for most to survive on. Because of this- I am asking our community for help. Any donation will go towards supporting our staff (i.e. continue payroll while we are closed) during this catastrophe- utilities- and the cost of building our food supply upon re-opening. I am in urgent need of your help to support my staff and to ensure that Modern Times can live through this disaster. I recognize our entire community is facing similar problems and I do not intend to impart further hardships on anyone. Please donate within your means. The world is ravaged by COVOID-19 and the harmful effects of this virus impacts us all.   I am asking for any financial help you have to offer. The continuation of this business falls in the hands of our community; just as it did when we opened. I am overwhelmed with joy for all that I have offered the community thus far and am feeling deeply helpless and vulnerable amidst turning away all 19 of our employees this morning.   Thank you for your continued support and contribution. I hope to have the privilege of serving you again in the future.    Sincerely-  Dylan Alverson  Owner and Chef  Modern Times Cafe  Minneapolis- MN",

L'Istituto infatti- punta di diamante della Sanit Lombarda- a cui tanti di noi - da ogni Regione d'Italia - si sono affidati o hanno affidato la vita dei loro cari- sta combattendo una dura battaglia:  proteggere i malati oncologici dal contagio da Coronavirus . E' vero- sappiamo poco di questo nuovo virus ma dai dati emerge una certezza:  chi è fragile  - a causa di patologie pregresse o concomitanti come quella oncologica -  è soggetto - a seguito del contagio-  ad una sintomatologia più aggressiva e potenzialmente letale .  L'Istituto dei Tumori di Milano - consapevole di questo rischio- ha attivato ed attiva ogni giorno una serie di procedure e accorgimenti per tutelare i malati oncologici evitando per quanto possibile di esporli al rischio di contagio da Covid-19. Ovviamente questo comporta l'impiego di  ingenti risorse economiche  necessarie- per esempio- per costruire  percorsi di assistenza dedicata - garantire l' utilizzo di locali specifici - acquistare  dispositivi di protezione adeguati ... insomma garantire l'ordinaria sicurezza in un momento di emergenza.  Salute Donna Onlus  sostiene da sempre l'Istituto dei Tumori ed oggi vuole impegnarsi in prima persona in questa battaglia lanciando questa campagna di raccolta fondi su Gofundme.com con la certezza che  ogni euro donato contribuir da subito a tutelare un malato oncologico .  Aiutiamo quindi l'Istituto dei Tumori ad essere   Virus Free . Conto sul vostro aiuto perché  insieme possiamo farcela . Seguite la nostra campagna sul nostro  sito  e sui nostri  canali social.  Potete contattarci scrivendo a info@salutedonnaonlus.it oppure chiamarci allo 02 647 0452.  Grazie.   Anna Mancuso  Presidente di Salute Donna Onlus",

   "description": "It is no secret that Lebanon has been struck by another crippling economic- financial and political crisis- which left many citizens across the country jobless and unable to support their families with the necessary needs to survive during these hard times.  In addition to the financial collapse- the novel coronavirus is stretching Lebanon's healthcare system; as of now the country has only allocated Rafik Hariri University Hospital to treat COVID-19 patients.   With the limited resources available and the on-going financial crisis Lebanon is facing- people who wish to be tested for COVID-19 are being charged 150-000 L.L (equivalent to 100 USD)- a charge which the majority of the population cannot afford.   Our goal is to reach as much good givers as possible- by donating through Our Fundraiser you will be supporting families who are currently struggling during this difficult time.  In an effort to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus in Lebanon- fifty percent of the funds will go to Rafik Hariri Hospital University to help them acquire the necessary medical supplies needed for the containment of COVID-19.  While the other fifty percent will go towards buying food and medication to the families in need across Lebanon.   In a country divided by religions- we have come together to give humanity another chance.  Thank you for your generosity and humanity.   The Team  #HelpThemtoHelpYou #theirsafetyisoursafety",

Douro Exclusive was founded in early 2012 after a deep concern for the tourist services in the Douro Wine Region of Portugal. Both Marco and Ana live in the Douro Valley with their two children- Salvador and Clara.  They lead with true passion- committed to excellence service- while sharing the genuine hospitality of the Portuguese culture.   Their livelihood depends on Douro Exclusive and as a result the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak has caused a tremendous financial loss- uncertainty with all cancellations and no tours- which has forced them to consider selling their means of transportation for both their family and Douro Exclusive and closing its doors.  With your support- Douro Exclusives will be able to continue on while also providing a livelihood for Marco- Ana and their children.  The funds will help them get through the uncertainties of this year and keep their business afloat and provide a means to help them pay off their loans. Not only will this impact them- but it will keep the rest of the Douro Valley alive- providing business to local winemakers.  Many of you may already know Marco and Ana from your previous visits to the Douro Valley and would be devastated to see Douro Exclusive close its doors. Their generosity and friendship has impacted your life as well as mine. I believe it's our turn to show them how grateful we are for them.",

For every $100 donated- bKL can make an additional 75 shields! For every $500 donated- thats the equivalent of 1/8 of another 3D printer.   If you are able- please consider donating any amount to assist us with this effort. All contributions will be used for additional printers and materials.  All 3D printers purchased using contribution funds will be donated to bKL's clients Chicago Public Schools and Chicago Public Library once the COVID-19 crisis has passed and/or PPE is more accessible.

China first- Italy and many other countries are suffering severe contagious situations.      WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION has just classified the disease as PANDEMIC which means it will be spreading around causing hospitalizations and deaths. Today March-11th Italy declared a complete stop of all commercial activities and people is allowed to leave home to go to work or buy essential goods.      The Desease is  very aggressive  to people over 60-70 years old- but it seems to be  gradually widening  this range.  People need to observe hygienic and social indications but especially need to STAY AT HOME if fever occurs.      In case you dont know- intensive care areas and  sanitary personnel are not enough to hold up a severe situation like some countries are already doing.  They are struggling- and working 12-14 hours shifts.      The FUNDRAISING is dedicated to all medical organizations to provide:   - oropharyngeal swabs  to all USA people who dont have medical insurance and to all people world wide who dont have the fortune of having a public health system. Donations will go to specific national non profit foundations/organizations   - respiratory protections- ventilators and life support machines  to hospitals and medical staff suffering the lack of production capacitiy; pharmacies and drugstores to provide them to people who cannot afford to buy them because of the unpleasant cost speculation   - liquidity  to medical organizations who will undergo financial default risk if not promptly supported  -any other kind of  medical stuff      The desease will cause a worldwide severe financial crisis.       More than ever we are all in the same boat and we need to support the cause and not a specific nation.     Every COVID19 hospitalization in intensive care means less opportunities to cancer and other people with bad illness to be assisted.   If we cannot avoid Cancer and other bad illness- we can avoid more COVID19 infections!!      People who has financial resources are strongly recommended to demonstrate SENSE OF CIVIC DUTY.     Society will be eternally grateful to those who will support the cause.    I personally love this Planet and all the people living in it without any discrimination.   I care about every one of you.   Things dont always happen to somebody else.      WHY am I fundraising?   There is no time left.  We need to act now to face the Pandemic COVID19 desease.   Every COVID19 hospitalization in intensive care means less opportunities to cancer and other people with bad illness to be assisted.   If we cannot avoid Cancer and other bad illness- we can avoid more COVID19 infections!!      How donations will be used?   I will personally keep contact with national organizations to support them.   Im also in contact with Italian Government representative.  I can also use my contacts in the USA and other countries to identify specific needs and send money to local organizations.  Every single dime left- if any- will go to non profit organizations.  You are allowed to send personal request related to COVID19 emergency so I can evaluate immediate donations.   My special thanks go to all those who will support.",

   "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic is something that has led to extreme panic and suffering across not only Canada- but the world. Many have died- and countless are left panicked at home unsure of whether or not they have contracted the virus. Due to global panic- the economy is taking a hit and people across the world have been forced to cancel events as a result of social distancing.   While the Canadian government is doing their best to slow the spread of COVID-19- we still feel the effects every day. Greater Vancouver and the Lower Mainland have been ravaged by empty stores and a fear of social contact. As a result of new social distancing recommendations put forth by the World Health Organization and the BC government- many are stuck in their houses and cannot access essential goods and services that they need to live. The elderly need help with their groceries- the immunocompromised need help with daily errands- and the general population needs information that is vital to keep them safe. Many people simply need a helping hand. Someone to drive out and grab them something. Someone to give them information about how to stay clean and to avoid contracting the virus. Others just need somebody to talk to.  There are currently many groups in and around the Greater Vancouver and Lower Mainland community- but few know about these services and they will be better off collaborating to maximize their impacts. This fundraiser is aimed at collecting funds to cover groceries and to pay for errands that people need to have done while in quarantine (if needed)- to make it easier for volunteers to get out and help- to create vital informational materials- and to fund care homes as well as homeless shelters.  The first step is to create a website that will include information- a sign up for those who need help and those who are able to give help- and volunteer opportunities for anyone who is able to come out during this tumultuous time. After- the money will be used to further fund initiatives that will secure goods for the homeless- help the immunodeficient- and fund other impactful programs. This platform will also allow various groups and organizations that are working towards the same goal to come together.   Another important step is to ensure that people who are feeling symptoms do not leave their homes. This means that they will need people to help them run their errands and to get equipment in order to sustain themselves. We can help contain this virus if we all work together.  If youd like more information as to where your money will be going- or how you can help in other ways- please reach out and Ill get back to you ASAP.  Lets unite to fight this emergency- and lets unite to fight COVID-19.",

   "description": "Each year- the United States Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame depends heavily on revenue received from its annual Induction Ceremony   Gala. The event typically brings in over HALF THE ANNUAL OPERATING REVENUE required for the organizations budget.   This years event scheduled for March 28th in Sun Valley- Idaho has been postponed due to COVID-19. While we look to other funding sources like state and local government relief- it does not look like we will be successful in those efforts due to the nature of this pandemic and the other worthy organizations applying for those same dollars.  These circumstances cause serious concern. We hope the individuals backing us will help where able. A successful fundraising campaign now will help ensure future operations and the ability to work through this and continue to honor and celebrate the athletes and industry pioneers who have shaped our sports in America.",

   "description": "We are making safe- reusable masks to make an impact.   NOTE: These masks will be given out for FREE to individuals who are at risk and medical professionals on the frontlines.   Did you know doctors- nurses- and healthcare workers are seeing COVID-19 patients without proper protection?    This is unacceptable. We have to help.   The CDC updated its guidelines saying that if no mask is available that a homemade mask (bandana/scarf) can be used. Hospitals around the country are DIYing masks or using the same mask everyday?   Upcycle it Now  is a design and manufacturing company that turns materials destined for the landfill into beautiful and functional products. As a small business we were struck by the immediate economic impact of this societal shift. We paid our employees for two weeks and shut the doors. We have been researching to find areas where we can make an impact to help our community and the wider world during this trying time.  Our mission is to increase the availability of quality reusable masks for those in essential businesses and for individuals that are the most vulnerable. With this effort we can give the general public the protection they need while reducing the demand on hospital supplies outside the hospital.  Our Co-Founder Christina Johnson     We have researched the CDC guidelines and developed a process to develop these reusable masks.

   "description": " Mission:   My Green Lunch  a school lunch catering company in the Santa Clara County has lost 90% of our business due to the Covid-19 crisis. The shutdown has left our 3-500 square foot kitchen and our fleet of 5 delivery vans underutilized. Now we are shifting our focus to provide safe and nutritious sealed meals to the homeless- elderly- sick- first responders and children in Santa Clara County. We are in contact with Santa Clara County officials regarding which specific locations in the Santa Clara County need the most help and with agencies that provide meals to those in need.   Being a kitchen and working with food we have strict hygiene (hand washing) rules in place for both personal and health code reasons. We are following our government's rules of Covid-19 prevention practices including and not limited to social distancing and sanitization. Additionally- we are doing health checks on our employees prior to entering our building.  This is a call to action for anybody that wants to directly help feed people in Santa Clara County during this Covid-19 crisis. Keeping yourself fed via delivery services and grocery stores that most Americans rely on is a necessary task that can't easily be completed while avoiding other people. As more Americans are quarantined- sheltered in placed- or practicing the recommended social distancing- supply chains will come under stress- people will still need food- and you can help fill that need.     Goal:  For every $5 donated- you will be providing 1 meal to someone in need. Our goal of $300-000 will enable My Green Lunch to provide up to 60-000 meals over the course of this \"\"20+ day shelter in place\"\". We can produce 3-000-5-000 meals a day- so with the $300-000 this ensures our ability to provide our target number of meals.     What your support means:  Our role as food producers is critical- and likely to become much more so during the next few months. Everyone's health and safety is important to us and we want to continue to provide the community with safe- nutritious- healthy food.  These are unprecedented times and we need to come together as a community to ensure meal relief. The demand for meals might not be here immediately- but in the coming weeks it is going to be in extreme demand. The people ofSanta Clara County need assistance and the service that we provide is VITAL.Join us in helping feed the people of Santa Clara County. The time for positive change is now and you can be the difference with as little as 5$ donated.  In community spirit-  The My Green Lunch Team",

   "description": "What if you Depended on a Food Bank for your Next Meal?    During these difficult times of increased fear and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic- it is easy to worry about ourselves and our families- stockpiling food   essential supplies in preparation for the worst possible- all whilst forgetting the needy- sick and vulnerable in our own neighborhoods.   The unsettling reality is that many in our neighborhoods and communities do actually depend on a Food Bank for their daily meals. At least 1 out of every 8 Canadian Households faces some form of food insecurity- with more than half of these households consisting of single-income- single-person- the elderly and those living with disabilities. And these numbers are only expected to grow due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak- making it hard for those already underprivileged to afford essentials like groceries.   DawaNets HalalServe Food Bank is an important community initiative that provides free bi-weekly Food Baskets to needy   persistently poor families in the Mississauga (Ontario- Canada) area- also offering home delivery to those with limited mobility. Typical baskets include an assortment of fresh produce- fruit- rice/ lentils   legumes- pasta- cereals- fresh milk   eggs- Halal meats- snacks and other healthy food items.   DawaNet would like to remind everyone to be patient- stay optimistic- take the necessary precautions to help protect yourselves and your loved ones against all harm- but to also not forget about HalalServe that provides essential food assistance to the most vulnerable in our local communities.    During COVID-19- please help HalalServe ensure:   Our existing clients continue to receive the basic bi-weekly food assistance we provide them- and Any additional needy individuals and families in the Mississauga area can be provided assistance via our Urgent Food Assistance program.    Remember- charity given sincerely never decreases wealth. Rather- it helps to increase the blessings in our wealth- and helps ward off misfortunes. Read more.

   "description": "A friend and co-worker of mine was trying to figure out what she could do in a world where we feel pretty helpless in the fight to slow the spread of COVID-19. Feeling restless in our newly furloughed state of employment like so many others- she heard on the news that there was a shortage of masks to protect against the spread of the virus. So she put her knowledge and skill to work and started making a pattern for the masks she that she then started producing in her own home to disperse to those in need.  She started a Facebook Page to share how to execute this task and to enlist anyone ready and willing to help with the cause. She was hit with a whirlwind of support and community outreach - people willing to sew- people willing to pick up and deliver the masks- and people to help organize and execute the operation. This was also followed by an incredible amount of requests for masks for the doctor's offices- hospitals- animal hospitals- and other places with high volume traffic.  This team of amazing people is working to fill an impossible demand and will continue to do so because it is what they have to give. They are also covering all the costs for the materials needed. There is also a lot of traveling that incurs cost for fuel or shipping costs.   This page is to try to give back to them so that they can continue providing this incredible service. They are helping to protect the people that are battling the fight against this virus- the people that work in businesses that remain open so that we can go to the doctor- buy food- get automotive repairs done- fill prescriptions- and the list goes on and on.  If you can help the funding of this group of volunteers- there is no amount too small. If you have the ability- please consider starting the production of masks in your area. The need for Personal Protective Equipment is real and will only get more daunting if we don't give it everything we have.    Thank you and be safe.",

   "description": "* If this site isn't working properly- you can use Venmo @tempos. We appreciate you!  Tempos Contemporary Circus was founded in 2012 as a performance company that melds partner acrobatics- dance- physical theatre- and music. Just a few months ago we took the plunge and opened our doors to offer public classes for adults of all fitness levels to explore circus arts- generate a love of movement and sense of play.    Unfortunately- because of the COVID-19 outbreak- we were forced to cancel all classes and programs on Sunday March 15th and lay off all of our coaches. However- rent- utility expenses- liability insurance- fees- etc still have to be paid- even though there is no income coming in.    Tempos Contemporary Circus usually relies on income from a regular schedule of adult classes and our 10 month professional training program- neither of which can operate during this pandemic. As information develops everyday- we keep pushing back our anticipated reopening date further and further. We are starting this fundraiser to keep Tempos afloat and be able to survive this pandemic.    Because Tempos is a small business set up as an LLC- your donation will not be tax deductible- but it will be just as valuable to us. Any small amount will help keep us alive during these stressful and uncertain times. Your donation will go directly toward making the payments to insurance- rent and utilities to ensure that Tempos still has a home whenever we can reopen!     We are hoping to raise $25-000- but if we exceed our goal that will allow us to offer money to the coaches who are out of work at this time. Please know we are committed to trying to make sure we all get through this together.    Tempos Contemporary Circus creates original productions from scratch collaboratively by sharing our experiences- fears- and hopes. We believe in building an engaged community of students- audience- and fellow artists. By having a studio space to return to- we can continue to foster creativity- share our love of movement- empower individuals- and bring people together.     www.temposcircus.com",

Right here in the valley of the sun- small business owners and their workers have had to close up shop indefinitely- praying for some kind of miracle to re-open before they are dead broke.  Even bigger businesses have shut down- like arenas and concert halls- leaving so many hourly workers out in the cold. I am a huge sports fan- and have had great experiences meeting the concessionaires- ushers and security folks at the pro arenas downtown- including Talking Stick Resort Arena (Suns)- Chase Field (DBacks) and more.

These struggling folks don't even know how they will survive April- let alone the months beyond.   This GoFundMe effort gives the more fortunate of us a chance to help the less fortunate.

Follow along at  www.BrightSideoftheSun.com  and/or my twitter page at  @DaveKingNBA  to see how I am disbursing every dime you donate to help someone affected by this pandemic.

   "description": "The COVID-19 virus fortunately has not impacted the state of Wisconsin in the ways a disease normally would. Unfortunately- however- our daily lives have been impacted under the intense triage of our infrastructure. In our community- you would find mostly low-income elderly workers who now cannot afford leaving their homes due to their hours being cut- and that's not even to say out of fear of the virus itself. Many of the workers in our community are in fear of losing their housing- cannot afford supplies- and fearing the idea of having to live the rest of their lives on the streets of Wisconsin. With the potential money I may raise here in the next few days will work towards giving our community a portion- and if possible- most of what it takes to afford their rent/payments- and whatever they need for food rations and medicine. I worry not for myself as I am a younger male who can find ways to make ends meet- but as for those around me I fear they cannot. I intend to help those in my community avoid losing everything and I am trying to the best of my ability and to persuade others to help our cause- and to do our part to help our shaking infrastructure. This country relies on every worker class as a unified whole- and I personally value the low and middle classes as hard workers and the basis on which this nation stands.",

The Small Business Relief Fund will be issuing $500 matching grants to qualifying businesses that raise at least $500 on GoFundMe.   The CoronaVirus (COVID-19) virus has affected many of us in the entertainment / DJ industry. Firstly- the obvious concern has been the cancellation of large scale gatherings such as sporting events- conventions- festivals- parades- corporate events- nightclubs/bars- restaurants- weddings and even now with any social gatherings.  Being an entrepreneur and self-employed is challenging. However- with the worldwide epidemic it has...literally killed my dancefloor. I depend on income from those sources to provide income to the ones in my life including my son- wife and those that I work with- believe in me- help me grow and succeed in my business. I have started this fund with the goal of providing relief in the next coming months.  I am also the owner of the idependent record label 51st Street Records Chicago and came out with our song \"\"Let's Come Together\"\" by Master C   J feat Reginald Hughes in November which ironically is a song that  we needed in this time to fight thewar of the Corona Virus together and united . Unfortunately due to low streaming and everyone downloading for free I haven't had any income due to the high demands required for the number of streams or likes either.   I've been in the music industry for over 43 years and I ask for your support as I have made many smile- created great memories- been part of major events   festivals- and even as an escape from everyday life problems through dancing and listening to the music I play to many audiences .  It is a time in my life where I ask for your support. Your donation would mean a lot to me and I would be grateful as I intend to pay it forward as I always do.

   "description": " Why is this important?   COVID19 brought to us a challenge of unprecedented magnitude. In this challenge our first responders are running out of supplies and the supply chain is also disrupted due to the pandemic.   The news media reports about the supply chain are not reassuring \"\"The US Food and Drug Administration has contacted dozens of medical device manufacturers whose facilities in China may be at risk of creating shortages in the supply chain -- and indeed- some facilities have already been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak\"\" (CNN)  Accounts of medical personnel at Hospitals in Portland- Seattle- and Alaska to name few are frightening and sad. for instance:  \"\"My wife is an ER Nurse at a local Portland hospital- their team is caring for COVID19 patients with extremely limited resources. Each time she re-uses a face shield or N95 mask she is putting her life and her patients at risk. We are so scared for her. Please help\"\"  \"\"Know that you are helping one pretty scared pregnant ER doctor in Alaska. I will keep going to work- it is my honor- but its not great that we aren't protected from this disease that is killing health care workers at a far higher rate than the community.\"\"  Any community energy- creativity and ingenuity that can be directed against this horrible disease is very much appreciated by the medical community who are battling at the front lines.   What are we doing about it?   At  Magnolia Titanium Open Source 3D maker studio  we are manufacturing face shields and creating other protective gear to aid close this huge gap for our medical community.  We are using  this model  created by Erik Cederberg to print the masks.     Currently we are working on another design to use even less material and speedup our print out times.   We are using soft biodegradable filaments for easy wear- easily sanitize- reuse the band portion- and replace the film portion.    How You Can Help:   We are volunteering our time and resources to 3D print and manufacture face shields- masks- and any other equipment for hospitals in need. We are donating 3D printer time- labor- and a lot of materials.   Your donations will help us extend far past what we can achieve on our own. Your donations will go towards more raw materials that we'll turn into personal protective equipment and medical devices. If/once this is all over- there is any money left in the fund it will be donated to the Red Cross. We have no intention of making any money off this and only want to help keep safe those risking their lives to save others.     ",

   "description": "Dear friends-  I hope you're all healthy and staying safe in these treacherous times. After days of contemplation I have finally decided to write this plea and reach out to you all for help. As many of you know- my husband works at a North Jersey Hospital and is on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. It is no secret that hospitals are struggling not only to keep up with the care of the massive influx of patients suffering from this deadly virus but also to provide for their staff who are the primary caregivers of these patients.  As hospitals and suppliers are struggling to meet the demands of the situation the ones who bear the major brunt of this extreme shortage are the nurses. Nurses are the backbone of any hospital and without the nurses working in full force no hospital would be able to fight this pandemic.  These nurses have been putting in long and stressful hours fighting COVID-19- while having to also care and provide for their own families and kids back at home- including additional child-care difficulty now that schools are closed. Some also have spouses and partners who may have been laid off or had hours or wages cut because of the current job situation- and they have to manage that as well- while putting on a brave front here in the hospitals for the benefit of all of us.  I have therefore set up a GoFundMe page to collect contributions towards showing appreciation for the nurses- this could be ordering meals for the whole team at the hospital while they are on shift- to providing meals for their families at home- to providing any urgent critical personal protection equipment (PPE) that may be in immediate shortage in the hospital- or critical equipment such as Respiratory Protection gear such as PAPRs.  Humanity has never before faced a crisis such as this and hopefully never should again. The nurses desperately need your help now more than ever before. Im reaching out to you today to please find it in your heart to donate any amount you can to my cause. With every dollar my husband can procure the necessary support needed for his staff and keep them safe and motivated in this hour of need.  If you could please support my GoFundMe by making a donation and sharing it with your network- I would greatly appreciate it. I know that money can be tight in these times but please know that even $5 helps me get closer to my goal! Let me know if you have any questions and Ill be happy to answer them.",

   "description": "Amidst the wide spread panic of the COVID-19 virus- and the need to take necessary precautions- such as social distancing - our Freelance Artist community is taking a staggering hit. As MUAs we work very closely with products   tools- to the anatomies which this virus can be transmitted.  As we approach what seems to be a complete lock down of our City- subsequently all gigs are being postponed or cancelled- and Clients are reaching out about retainers and deposits. Freelancers rely on these bookings to sustain their businesses- health and families. So many of the Artists in our immediate Community are Mothers- or take care of other family members. NYC schools has been shut down for 8 weeks- leaving parents with the added worry of providing childcare and extra meals and activities during this time. We're all aware of the exorbitant rent   mortgages that comes along with living in NYC. Artists and their families are facing a laundry list of economic and emotional hardship in the coming months.  The need for resources- connection- support and community is dire! Some of us have pledged monies to larger funds- but we're that these funds will not reach our smaller Artist community here in NYC.  We intend to distribute the funds collected here to at least 200 Makeup + Hairstylists serving in the NYC area. We the organizers- will focus the outreach on the Artists in our immediate network. Although- we've set goals --- it would be through the kindness and compassion of you- our clients- colleagues and supporters that we will drive to reach or surpass this outreach goal. A little can go far in a time like this.  We believe this is the time to test the power of our faith- our gifts- our connections and the communities we've all worked so hard to grow. Over the years we've cheered these Artists on as they've SERVED (literally + figuratively). When this shift is over- we hope to come out on the other side- and see the Artists we've grown to love- standing next to us.  NO ARTIST LEFT BEHIND!  We may not have all we need right now- but together we have it ALL!  If there are other ways you can help besides monetarily- please contact us via email or DM.

Unfortunately- the reality of the situation has forced us to furlough much of our staff until things normalize- we can start pouring beers at our Taproom again- and our friends in the bar/restaurant industry get back on their feet too. This means everyone who works in the brewery has been impacted in some way- from the production staff to the sales reps out in the field.  We've seen an outpouring of support online and appreciate everyone getting take-out from our Taproom in Croydon. This is just one other way you can support us as we navigate this difficult situation. All of the funds raised here will go directly to those on our staff who aren't able to work. We know things may be tight for you too so any little bit helps and we're also accepting virtual high-fives!  Your support over the last 8 years has gotten us to this point and we can't wait to get back up and running so we can share a beer with you again! We appreciate anything you're able to contribute.   Thank you - cheers!

   "description": "COVID-19 has proven to be an extremely difficult time for all and specifically for our iHOPE families. The International Academy of Hope (iHOPE) serves children- adolescents- and young adults from ages 5 years to 21 years old- who have sustained acquired brain injuries or other brain-based disorders and who cannot be served in their local school systems. School is closed and students are home for at least 4 weeks. This crisis has put some of our parents out of work and has left all of them simultaneously juggling a variety of roles as caregivers- nurses- teachers- and therapists. Preparing meals can be financially challenging and is another time-consuming task to add to their long list of responsibilities.  On March 18th- my selfless co-worker Jennifer and her husband Maba began the brilliant idea and execution of driving to different grocery stores in the NYC area in order to buy enough food to hand-deliver home-cooked meals to our iHOPE families' doorsteps. However- due to the growing number of families in need of meals and the extended amount of time that the COVID-19 crisis is going to last- this act of kindness has grown larger than a two-person job. Because of the extreme generosity from all of you- they have not had to turn away any family in need of free meals- and for that that we are truly grateful. The incredible support we have received has allowed us to expand this effort in order to continue providing these meals as long as they are needed.  Beginning on Monday- March 23rd- my other incredible co-worker Laura and her husband Carlos will continue to purchase groceries and prepare all of the meals. Carlos Rodriguez is a professional chef and is volunteering his time to help our families. He has worked in restaurants including The Brasserie- Dos Caminos- and Jane! Additionally- we have recruited Chris (another co-worker of mine) to make all of the deliveries.   We are so thankful for all of the help everyone has provided us to keep this food program going! Our families have many concerns right now and food should not be one of them. Help us take something off of these families' plates by continuing to fill them with delicious food! If you are interested in getting involved and ensuring that this food program continues while safely socially distancing in your home- consider donating to this amazing cause. Any amount helps! THANK YOU!",

Several of you have suggested that you would like to help us in this very difficult time and offered donations for which we are very grateful and greatly humbled by such thoughtfulness.

So we have set up an account with Go Fund Me where you can make a Donation of your choice.   We will keep everyone updated with day to day life at Northbrook and some fun pics of the horses.  Thank you for your continued support and we really look forward to opening again and seeing you all; enjoying the horses and your time here with us.

But we are more than a safe home for the Elephants- we are an opportunity for the community; to improve education- conserve the natural world and bring everyone together in trying to preserve the remaining elephants of Cambodia.  Today- this vision is under threat. The outbreak of the CoViD-19 has negatively impacted Cambodias tourism in such a way that we are now fearful. Fearful that we now may struggle to sustain ourselves alone. Our self-sustaining model relied on tourism to finance our basic operations- and being so new- we did not have the time to save enough for this kind of contingency.  We need YOUR HELP to care for them.   Especially our oldest elephants who need more food- supplements and medical supplies.   $1000 = cost to care for 1 elephant per month  $20 = daily food cost for 1 elephant  $10 = daily medical cost for 1 elephant.   If you would like to help- please spread the message- donate or contact us about any support you might want to offer.",

   "description": "For the past 10 days- Jennifer Eason and William Eason of Jennifer's Edibles have been providing free delivered dinners to Evanston's seniors and those most vulnerable to Covid-19. They started with five requests and are now serving 52 people. They have a growing group of volunteers who shop for- prepare- and deliver the meals- and they're hoping to increase their capacity and serve 100 seniors every day for the next 30 days. For many of the people who have requested a meal- William says- it's the only meal they eat.  The brother and sister pair have shut down the restaurant for all other business and are focusing solely on this effort to keep seniors fed during the Coronavirus crisis.  In order to serve 100 people each day for the next 30 days--that's 3-000 meals--they need to raise $21-000- or $7 per meal.  Can you help? ________  Required by GoFundMe: I'm Nina Kavin.  I live in Evanston. I'm raising funds for Jennifer's Edibles because I've known Jennifer and enjoyed her restaurant and her food for the past five years- and I admire Jennifer and William's selfless efforts to support our community at this time of great need.",

TUTTO IL RICAVATO sar devoluto completamente all'ospedale Amedeo di Savoia di Torino- unit di terapia intensiva.   Il ricavato sar versato- tramite bonifico bancario- direttamente sul conto dell'ospedale- che provveder a destinare il denaro nel miglior modo possibile (attrezzatura- posti letto e ricerca).   Dimostrerò personalmente l'avvenuta devoluzione della somma raggiunta pubblicandogli estremi della ricevuta bancaria e dell'avvenuta lettera di ringraziamento da parte dell'ospedale Amedeo di Savoia.

   "description": "South Africa is starting emergency procedures to respond to COVID19. Domestic workers in South Africa- often single mothers- will be on the frontline of many dramatic social changes that need to take place to prevent escalation of the virus.  What do we know already?   1   Cleaning your hands regularly is of utmost importance.  2   Social distancing is key - that means keeping a 6 foot distance from     the nearest person wherever possible.  Thousands of domestic workers in South Africa travel by public transport in cramped minibuses to get to work. They are not covered by medical aid and paid leave planned for such extraordinary times unlikely.   This go fund me initiative is to raise money that will help alleviate the burden of COVID19 on domestic workers who are single mothers.  The minimum wage for a domestic worker is R15 per hour (around $1). Minimum wage per month for a 40 hour work week will be R2-500 (around $160).  It is envisaged that a $250 \"\"care package\"\" per single mother would enable them to take a month of paid leave and buy sufficient sanitary equipment (soap- hand sanitiser etc) to take care of themselves and their extended families in terms of handwashing and cleaning surfaces that may have been contaminated by the virus.   What will your money help to do?    Your money will help 500 single mothers buy the necessary supplies to keep their hands clean and sanitise their surrounds and family as best they can; and take leave to remain at home for four weeks and encourage as much social distancing as possible.  These mothers will also be able to participate in free online sessions offered by the host of this go fund me platform to learn about hand washing and offer a more general support basis during COVID19 crises ",

   "title": "Unexpected Travel Costs thanks to COVID-19",
   "description": "Hey guys. If you don't know- I am currently in Europe on what was supposed to be a 2.5 month European tour. As is often the case- life happened- and I am now trying to come home much earlier than expected. Originally I was supposed to go to 11 countries: England- Norway- Denmark- Germany- Czech Republic- Hungary- Italy- Greece- (back to Italy)- Switzerland- Spain- and Scotland. Due to COVID-19- things changed. It started out with just skipping Rome- Italy and staying in Budapest. But then it escalated. And Venice was put into lockdown- which means I didn't have transportation to Lucerne and Zürich- Switzerland. I just rolled with the punches and replaced Italy and Switzerland with Portugal- but as you can guess- it has spread here- too. To top things off- my travel partner- in fear of catching it and giving it to his grandparents- decided to return home rather than risk exposure- so I am now here all alone on a different continent in the middle of a pandemic.  This morning- I awake to dozens of messages from family and friends regarding the travel ban enforced by Donald Trump last evening- which takes effect Friday at midnight. To clarify- I- as a US citizen- am not banned from returning home to the US- though I will be subject to testing and potentially placed in quarantine for at least two weeks. When I initially heard the news- there was so much I didn't know- so you can imagine my panic. And if I was panicking this much- imagine how the rest of the world is feeling. I mean- Denmark canceled all flights in and out of the country. Holy cow.   You don't need me to tell you about Coronavirus. I don't have it and I am hoping to avoid it. It is something I am aware of and expect- and will deal with if and when the time comes. When I left for this trip- one thing I didn't expect the outbreak to spread this severely. Not to mention the financial impact it would have on me personally. Between getting new flights to avoid Italy- and canceling multiple weeks of the trip to avoid more travel bans- I have incurred just over $2-000 (this trip was originally supposed to be a TOTAL of $1-600 for flights and accommodations) in nonrefundable flights that weren't/won't be used- new flights to different- safer areas in Europe- and non-refundable accommodations alone- not including the cost of having to add in another new flight just to get home. These costs were not factored in at the beginning of the trip- and seeing as I'm still stuck in Europe and not home where I can be working yet- it is all a little daunting.   Now I know that coming home early is my choice. It is not that I am afraid of getting sick. I am more worried about more and more countries adding travel restrictions and bans- and do not want to be stuck in a country that is on full lock down- like Italy is now. I just want to be home and safe. I am hoping to get home before countries begin to cancel flights to the US. It is only a matter of time- and there is too much uncertainty to risk staying in Europe with the possibility of being unable to come home.   The money raised here will go toward helping to ease some of the sting of the unexpected costs incurred during this trip. Anything you can chip in to help would be more than appreciated. I am so thankful for the kindness I have received with people checking to make sure I have somewhere to stay if I do have to stay in Europe- and with others checking to see what my plan is to get home. I will keep everyone updated here on my plans. Thank you for being willing to read this and even considering helping me out. I really appreciate it more than you know and am truly humbled by the kindness of others.",

   "description": "Why are we doing this?  This operation began as a simple conversation among friends and neighbors about what can be done to help slow down the spread of CoVID19 in the US- especially the DFW area. The conversation quickly heated up as we learned that hospitals and medical personnel were running out of personal protective equipment (PPE). Recognizing how devastating this could soon become- the group could no longer sit still. We decided to do something to help the local and state medical institutions and personnel prepare for the pandemic. We want to unite the community to raise money and PPE for our heroes- the medical professionals fighting against the CoVID19 for all of us.   What will we do?  We understand medical institutions have protocols in vendor specification and logistics. We aim to avoid disrupting existing order and process. Theres also risk and liability involved. However- we decide to move forward to do as much as we can in the following areas based on demand.   Who are our targeting recipients of help?  Medical professionals- doctors- nurses- caregivers and their family. Well focus on DFW metropolitan but may reach out to Texas state wide as we see fit. High risk groups- including elderly and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.   What will be provided?  PPE with FDA approval. In rare cases- recipients may knowingly accept equipment with lower specification due to lack of more qualified ones. This needs to be explicitly disclosed and agreement signed. Community service to help high risk groups shop or do other errands as needed.   What happens if we have some money and resources left?  There is ZERO overhead for this fund. We're reaching to local hospitals to help. We will donate whatever is left to three institutions: Parkland- Childrens Hospital and UTSW after the virus is contained or the steering committee agrees that the mission is accomplished.",

   "description": "As everyone knows that many places and events are closed/cancelled/postponed or closing because of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Because of these actions- lyft and uber drivers get hit hard because there are no riders to pickup. The luxury drivers like myself even hit harder because of the stop in traveling. As you may or may not know- lyft and uber drivers are independent contractors and may not qualify for government stimulus or unemployment benefits. Many- many drivers do this job full time- which include leasing or financing used and new vehicles. These drivers rely on weekly pay from driving to pay for vehicle- gas- insurance- maintenance- and their own personal bills and livelihood.    Many of these drivers do not do it because they will get rich- but because they love to be independent- love to drive- and interact with the public. I am a driver- so I know what is happening in real-time. In the past week- Second week in March 2020) I have been on the street with my app on for 34 hrs during the week mentioned above and only got Eight (8) rides with a total of $118.24. That amount is just for gas. Not only the rides are down- but the chance of catching the virus as well.   If you ever take lyft and or uber or have an understanding how the gig economy works or so on- please make a donation.  It is hard for hail-ride drivers to just stay home and don't know where they are going to get their next dollar. This is real! This fund will help drivers to at least pay few important bills. This virus is a calamity that hits many sectors across the world.  Whatever amount you can donate- please do so. Around 80% of the State of Massachusetts shuts down for at least Three (3) weeks- with no concrete end in sight. These are crucial and trying times for everyone.  This donation will make a different to vulnerable drivers that rely on that weekly funds.  On behalf of Massachusetts lyft and uber drivers- we need your help and thank you in advance.",

   "title": "Handwashing Stations: COVID-19 in Zimbabwe",
   "description": "  MEND COLLECTIVECOVID-19 Preventative Action inZimbabwe:    The current COVID-19 pandemic is starting to emerge in Zimbabwe.   There is no mandatory lockdown as of yet so people continue to move without restrictions; we want to ensure that this is done with health   safety in mind and heeding to WHO's hand washing recommendations.  Given that hand sanitiser is scarce   unaffordable for many-  Mend Collective  is launching an initiative with Zimbabwean volunteers to make   distribute 50 hand washing water stations from sanitised   disinfected recycled bottles.  The hand washing stations will be distributed in and around Harare- free of charge. We are working with local authorities to target high density areas where the risk of spreading the infection is greatest.  These hand washing stations are made from affordable materials- providing an inexpensive solution that can be easily be replicated in the home.  Each stand will be distributed with:    5 litres of clean water- which will allow for 30 washes/bottle   Soap to last for two weeks (which will be put into the bottle at the recommended concentration)  We are also raising awareness with posters- verbal explanation   demonstration as well as an accompanying video for households that wish to copy the hand washing station for their personal use.  Upon distribution- members in local communities will be asked to take responsibility for the refilling of the stations- and advised on how to do so.   Each hand washing station costs £6.00 to make and distribute. This money covers the cost of the syringe- the wire cage- the soap distributed with the hand washing stations- disinfectant for the recycled bottles- the glue gun and fuel for transporting the stations to the high density areas.   Please consider making a donation to support this much needed initiative.    NOTES REGARDING THE DESIGN    These hand washing stations are intended to be used in high density urban settings. They are therefore required to be portable.  We also appreciate that the design does involve the use of hands on the syringe- however we trialled the foot pedal \"\"tippy tap\"\" design but found it to be incompatible for the desired needs.  Ongoing efforts will be made to improve the design- if/as required.  The design has also been run past a Medical Doctor who is at the forefront of COVID-19 research within Zimbabwe.     ABOUT THE FUNDRAISERS    Shannon Hart is based in Harare- Zimbabwe and is the Founder of Mend Collective. She has made   trialled these specific hand washing stations based on the  WESOZ YouTube Video . Together with the Team on the ground- she will use any money raised to purchase the necessary materials to make   distribute the hand washing stations.   Lara Rickard is a Zimbabwean resident   a Registered Dietitian based in the UK. She will be collecting the money and using Western Union to transfer the funds to Shannon Hart who will use the money to work through Mend Collective and the Team in Zimbabwe.   Information of funds received- invoices   receipts will be shared regularly on this platform.    OTHER WAYS TO DONATE    For all Zimbabweans wanting to support or be involved but are financially unable to do so- donations of the following supplies are hugely appreciated:     Jik    Bars of \"\"Green\"\" soap   5 litre water bottles   Wire for the hanging cages    Fuel for distribution of the washing stations  Please contact Shannon Hart on: 0784769674",

   "description": "This emergency fund was created for our hospitality members of Providence- Rhode island who have been directly affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic. If you are a hospitality employee- we are also setting up FREE CHILDCARE over the next few weeks.  Over the last 72 hours- we have already seen over 100+ layoffs within the hospitality industry. Our tourism has halted- and the locals are beginning to fear eating out. Businesses are making major cut-backs-because they realistically- can't afford to take another loan.  This last week has been a real tough one for Rhode Island. We are the smallest state- where our communities are run by a majority of small business owners. The small business owners here in lil' Rhody are what make this little state one of the greatest places to dine and explore- and within that- our employees are the backbone to the Creative capital.  While schools began closing- grocery stores were being wiped clean- and resources are becoming less and less available- hospitality employees are met with the hard reality that we were next. Childcare has become too expensive- sufficient meals per day are becoming optional- and bills are climbing. This communityshut down has affected every single person in this state.   If you've had a great cocktail- an incredible meal- or just an overall great experience dining out- you know who these people are. Rhode Island is an incredibly supportive community- and right now we need your help to support our community members at an incredibly stressful time. Please consider donating so we can help support the people that make Rhode island great.  If you are in need of assistance- please fill out this form.

Founder Saengduean Lek Chailert will distribute the money to those who are in need. The money is needed immediately as the elephants' heath deteriorates with each passing day. The funds will be spent on buying food and rehiring mahouts ( elephant caretakers) so the elephants get the care they need. Please donate! all amounts count. Each penny will go a long way to help these beautiful ones. All of these elephants have already suffered tremendously they don't deserve this slow terrible death.

   "description": "Hi everyone-  We are Maria and Sue- best friends looking to help make a difference in the COVID crisis.  The PPE (personal protective equipment) shortage is real. Despite media coverage and the government's assurances that masks are being delivered- our front line workers are not getting them. Every day- doctors- nurses- PCAs- and respiratory therapists are terrified to go to work- constantly worrying about the PPE supply and what will happen when these essential items run out.  These healthcare providers are being forced to wear the same mask for long shifts- only allowed to change them out a week at a time. While many of us get to stay home during this pandemic- they are literally going to war... putting their own lives at risk to save others each and every day. We cannot let them go into battle without the proper protective equipment. These heroes deserve a safer way to do their jobs- so that they can continue to save lives while minimizing the risk of exposure to themselves.  We're calling on the community to please help us help them. To aid ongoing efforts- we are raising money to make filtered masks for those on the front line. 100% of the funds will go towards these masks and other essential equipment.  Other ways you can help:  - Please share this link with friends   family.  - If you have fabric- elastic- thread- filters- or any other material that you would like to donate- please contact us. Every bit helps!  Thank you! Maria Bizzoco   Sue Monteleone",

   "description": "The Emergency   Many communities in Boston are facing a terrible crisis as the city works to fight the spread of COVID-19. Even before any large scale outbreaks- major universities and schools have shut down. Massachusetts has declared a state of emergency. As businesses close and institutions enact proactive quarantine measures- many in the Boston area are left stranded with little income- or even zero income.  The lowest wage earning communities- such as students- food service workers- and families living paycheck to paycheck- face the greatest risk and are living in a resource crisis today.   This crisis is only escalating.  For instance- on March 10- Harvard and MIT released statements ordering students to leave campus and not return for the remainder of the semester. With only a few days notice to vacate their dorms-  many students- especially international- low income- and first generation students- face the impossible task of finding high-cost last minute arrangements for flights- housing- and meals.  Many are turning to the alumni and local communities for assistance. Many of these students are our customers.  -----   How You Can Help   Your support allows us to continue our mission to provide affordable- high quality- and healthy foods to our community through innovation and dedication. Saté Grill (momogoose) is an award winning food truck that has served the Boston and Cambridge community for over 30 years. It is our tradition- experience- expertise to solve food service problems and challenges in unconventional settings and unique circumstances. Last year- together with our supporters-  we were able to donate more than 30-000 meals to the U.N. World Food Program.    Now- in the wake of COVID-19- we have a touchless/contactless highly sanitized meal delivery system that allows us to feed a large amount of people while minimizing the risk of infection.  Our mobile kitchens allow us to serve hot and healthy meals to vulnerable communities that are required to shelter in place- such as senior citizens- low income families with unpaid sick leave under quarantine- or students facing the sudden loss of room and board. In addition to being continually affordable-  your support would provide contactless meals completely free to those in need during the crisis.  We will initially implement our system at MIT where we already serve thousands of meals every week. The meal service will expand to other parts of Boston to provide hot- healthy meals to those in need all across our beloved community. We will provide progress updates as the program expands.  Every dollar donated toward this campaign is guaranteed to go toward providing affordable and healthy meals to those who would otherwise suffer in the face of the COVID-19 protection measures. Food is a critical need for our community as many Boston families and students struggle to survive this unprecedented crisis. We set the bar high- and we will deliver!  Thank you for your donation to our cause. Thank you for allowing us to leverage our resources to make a difference in our community.  -----   Beyond Donations   To help get the word out- please share the link to this campaign on social media!

   "description": "Hey- hon- welcome in!\"\"  It's words that I've said on a daily basis since I finally completed my dream of opening Court of Gamers- running my own business. I tell the story all the time- how the really beat up open close sign hanging in our front window has been under my bed since I was four years old and boldly claimed to my parents that I was only ever going to work for myself. Not exactly how it worked out- but close enough for me to still happily flip that sign every single day.  Court of Gamers is a family. I can't tell you how many times I've heard the words \"\"Coming here is like coming to a friends house.\"\" it's what I strive for every day. We're a place to escape the world that is stressful and hard. The idea of losing CoG (As she's affectionately known) terrifies me to my core.  The last few days have been filled with tears as I have stressed over my small business. But I know I'm not alone in this. COVID-19 is threatening small businesses- non-profits- and so many more. Which is why we're running our GoFundMe a little bit differently than others.  We know you can only donate so much- and money can only go so far. That's why Court of Gamers- is going to help others. A portion of your donations will go to help other small businesses- most specifically a small Chinese restaurant. If you've been to CoG- you've probably been to the wonderful Tang St. They're a second family to us- and neither of us want to continue without the other.  Secondly we're going to be giving a portion to Thrive Youth Center. Thrive is an amazing wonderful place. I've been so fortunate I've never needed their help- but so many LGBTQ kids do. With colleges closing people are forced to go home right now- and sometimes home isn't the best place- or even worse- not an option.  Court of Gamers has never been about me- my store- my life. It's always been about you- even if you reading this has never been into CoG. It doesn't really matter. CoG has always been there for you- a safe haven- an inclusive haven. With your help and with the help of #SmallBusinessRelief- we're not going anywhere. We're going to help our neighbors in these trying times. We will see the other side of COVID-19  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this- and thank you even more if you hit that donate button. May the days ahead be better than those behind us.

   "description": "Hello everyone!  Our family would like to take this time to help our community come together and help each other in the time of need. We all know that in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak- schools have closed and classes have been moved to online work and AMI packets. Some employers are not closing per se- but having employees work from home- restaurants and bars are offering carry out or delivery only options- some businesses are just closing their doors until further notice- others are limiting hours of operation that were previously open 24 hours in order to re-stock and sanitize the stores. The service and entertainment industry has been severely impacted with the vast majority of the community staying at home and social distancing.  We also know that most grocery stores have been completely depleted of supplies. Some of this was due to people over-buying or hoarding- as some may call it. But- by doing so- those that cant get out and shop- get paid once a month- or live paycheck to paycheck (like our family) were not able to buy what they needed until after it was all gone- if at all.  With school being cancelled for at least the next week and then Spring Break on top of it- food and staple household items will not last the normal amount of time until people get their next paycheck. This is assuming they are still receiving a paycheck.  Oh yeah�the fundraiser�this fundraiser is geared for the community to be able to come together by donating in order to purchase items for families with immune-compromised members- elderly people and those that are over 60 years of age that should not be in the public or unable to shop physically- those that have been impacted by loss of income/jobs- and families that have children who may be struggling to make staple items last due to the school systems being shut down.  Examples of items that would be purchased with donated money would include- but not limited to:  · Toilet Paper (If available in stores)  · Bread  · Milk  · Cereal  · Oatmeal  · Peanut Butter  · Jelly  · Rice  · Pasta/Mac   Cheese/Boxed Dinners  · Frozen Meat  · Frozen/Canned Vegetables  · Potatoes  · Canned/Dried Beans  · Canned fruit  · Snacks for children (crackers- gummies- juice boxes etc.)  · Diapers  · Baby Wipes  · Baby Food  · Baby Formula  · Cleaning Products (as they are available in stores)  **Note**: Once donations start coming in- we will update the fundraiser page and the original Facebook post that we shared and post comments on our original posts on how to nominate a family in need. Also- we do know that at this time- we will be limiting the nominations for Benton County only.  Thank you all in advance for your support and love for the community. Now is the time for love and calmness and trust in the community to help each other. Also- when we do have nominations we will provide a form to be filled out for the family for their needs.  Thank you- Ashleigh   Michelle",

   "description": "Who We Are   We are the teachers and staff members of  Infinity Movement Studio . We teach salsa- bachata- reggaeton- Afro-fusion- and Contemporary dance. We lead yoga- pilates- and other fitness classes for all ages and levels. We host a community gathering of dancers weekly every  Friday night from 8 PM to Midnight  and organize free monthly Yoga classes for our community called  Yoga in the Barn  .    Kids Performing on a Friday night in May 2017    Kids Performing at Salsa in Hawaii in February 2018    Yoga in the Barn in June 2019     Our Cause is Ensuring is the Health and Safety of our Community   Infinity Movement Studio is a small- local Hawai'i business of wellness and fitness in the heart of Kaka'ako on the island of Oahu- Hawaii. The highest priorities for our business are the health and safety of our students- teachers- and their respective families. To protect our Ohana of dancers- yogis- and teachers- we have closed our doors. We believe that adhering to the most restrictive guidelines provided by the  CDC is the only way to ensure the well-being of our community.  We love our community and want to continue providing a warm- friendly space for everyone. Unfortunately- we can not bring people together safely during an infectious disease outbreak. Our studio has been in business for one year; however- our dance company-  Linda Melodia  -  has been in Honolulu for seven years providing the most organized- progressive dance classes in Hawaii. We have operated on a tight budget over the past year to affordably serve the community with the highest quality of instruction and wish to continue doing so.   We adamantly  oppose any social gatherings  during this pandemic irrespective of how damaging it is to our business model. Closing our doors prevents us from teaching new students- providing our services- and generating the necessary revenue to stay in business.  Our primary goal at this time is to  promote mental health and motivation  for individuals at home with our streaming classes. We hope our quality instruction and reliability during this outbreak will keep people home- minimizing the spread of COVID-19.       Allocating the Funds   We accepted the detrimental financial implications of limiting the number of students in person and canceling our Friday night socials. We took aggressive action to minimize the spread of COVID-19 prior to the local  government mandating the closure  of all nonessential businesses. As of the 23rd of March- we taught classes exclusively online via Zoom.  The deficit in revenue has left us scrambling to purchase the necessary equipment to provide high-quality- streaming content. We did our best to save money by looking through our inventory of audio and video equipment before buying anything. We have- additionally- sourced equipment from our teachers including personal computers (MACs and PCs)- smartphones- and cameras to minimize the up-front costs associated with moving our classes online. We estimate that we reduced our starting costs from $1000s to $200-$300 by only needing to purchase specific essential equipment- such as an  HDMI processing card - and a few adapters.    Our Thrifty Online Recording Studio   As resourceful as we have been in the past few weeks we have not generated the necessary revenue to pay rent ($13-500). We will use funds exclusively for paying rent. We will use revenue generated from streaming classes to ensure that our teachers continue to receive the income on which they rely.  Additionally- any donations generated above our initial goal will be used to pay for rent as we continue to promote social distancing as the primary method for preventing spreading COVID-19.   What Your Donations Mean to Us   We want to come out of this Pandemic and see the same smiling faces to which we have become accustomed over the years. You- your friends- your family- and our community need to stay home to save lives. We want our business to give hope and provide unity to the common goal of keeping everyone healthy. We wish to keep our business from failing during the time which we are closed. Instead- we want to continue providing togetherness by building an online dance community that will come back together after we weather this pandemic. Please help us keep our community and studio alive.   Thank you!   We understand that most of our dancers have done what they can to stick with us as we make the move to an online system. We thank you for allowing us into your homes virtually. We are grateful that you take the time to keep your routine with us. We ultimately want to grow our   Infinity Movement Studio   Salsa- Bachata- Yoga- and Pilates communities as much as possible.  Join us!   We offer Yoga seven days a week online.  If you are facing difficult times- as well- then we plead that you donate a minimum of $10 to help keep our studio solvent until the end of this pandemic.  We wish you well- The Teachers and Students of Infinity Movement Studio   You CAN Do More   Please stay home- at least- for now! Help us by donating to our cause and by sharing this Gofundme on your Facebook profile and Instagram account and by emailing your network.  #COVID-19 #SocialDistancing #SmallBusinessRelief",

   "description": "Hello- my name is Beverly and I am trying to raise money for those undergoing financial stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in North New Jersey.  I have noticed many employees are unable to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic - more specifically- restaurant owners and their employees. Although some have take-out available that still leaves some without the ability to do so. The pandemic is not only affecting the safety/health of our people but also their income.  During this economic crisis- the best thing we can do is come together and panic less. This emergency campaign is for the employees in the hospitality industry who are out of work and have no other form of income. These employees- just as the employees that are able to work from home- have responsibilities over family members- bills- medical necessities- etc.- but have no means of secondary income.  I am asking for any donation possible for those in need and with limited options for income - I already have a list created for Sabor Latin Bistro in North Bergen + Sedona Taphouse in Cliffside Park. **If you are among the employees with a financial circumstance listed above- please contact me directly. I will need your full name- the name/location of your job- your job title- and the number to your job for verification.  Again- any donation is appreciated! All proceeds will be evenly distributed among employees in the North New Jersey area who are in the hospitality industry and are temporarily out of a job due to the abrupt closing of their companies. I empathize with those struggling and would love to offer my support in their time of need. So with your selfless donation- you are alleviating any financial stress they are currently undergoing.  Thank you for taking the time to read this. We are eternally grateful! :)  *When you give in abundance- you shall receive in abundance*  PS. I will be providing proof/documentation as needed!",

I am a single mother to an awesome 16 year old boy and like many people who have found themselves in tough times due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic- we are in need of a hand-up.  I was recently informed that due to a slowing economy- that I would be losing my biggest client effective immediately. That client- who I have worked for for years- covered all of the basic needs that my son and I have- including my car note- insurance- power- WiFi- groceries- etc. The loss of this income is detrimental to our daily lives.   Though I am fortunate enough to have other- smaller sources of income- they do not even come close to taking care of our basic needs.  In two weeks I will not be able to pay our bills.  I am asking for help to keep Justin and I afloat until a) I am able to secure more work and/or b) my client is able to resume services. However with the threat of extended shut-downs and closings- I am fearful that this process will take longer than my current finances allow.  I have faith that I will soon be able to get back on track- however the thought of what will happen in two weeks if I'm not able to secure more work immediately is heavy on my heart and spirit.  I realize that there are thousands of people in this situation- and consider any donation to our family a blessing.  Thank you so much.",

   "description": "COVID 19 has already been devastating for musicians in the UK- and the communities and economies which are built around them. It doesn't look like getting better any time soon.  Venues are closing- gigs are being cancelled- the mechanisms for making a living out of making art are shutting down.  Everyone's health is - rightly - the primary concern right now- and after that people's ability to survive financially with rent- bills and food to pay for.  But it's no small concern that our cultural landscape could be devastated by the end of all this if we don't act to keep it alive.   I run the Marketstall Recording studio in East London. We're a small independent studio who mostly work with self-funded and DIY artists. They don't have big record deals with major labels to support them through hard times. And right now- they cannot afford to continue making their art - the stuff that helps keep you sane and happy while you're self-isolating.   What we're trying to do is establish a fund that struggling artists can access to continue making and sharing their art during this time. We're asking for contributions towards studio time at Marketstall Recording for artists in exactly this predicament.   By donating to this fundraiser you'll not only be helping support these artists- but also this small independent business.  Our relationship with the artists we work with is symbiotic- and we're feeling the effects of all this too.  Our aim- initially- is to raise £1-000 which is the equivalent of 5 days of studio time. This would normally be enough time to record and mix and EP- or sometimes even a whole album! But hopefully we can raise much more.  If you're a regular gig-goer you'd usually be spending money on concert tickets and drinks and merchandise. While there aren't any gigs for you to go and spend your money at- we'd like yo to consider donating some of it to this fund in order to keep the music scene - and the artists and independent business who make it - going during a difficult time- so it's still there- vibrant and alive when everything goes back to normal.  Without your continued support \"\"normal\"\" might look quite different on the other side of all this ...     If you'd like to know more about the studio and/or the artists we work with please visit  www.marketstallrecording.com  or drop me a message here- I'll be happy to chat with with you :)",

   "description": "I am a Cancer researcher based in London and- in this critical moment- I volunteered to put my laboratory skills into service to support Public Health England centre in Colindale with the testing of Covid_19. Nevertheless- my mind also goes back home in Italy- which is now facing the most severe virus outbreak outside China.  You might have seen the dramatic pic of the exhausted nurse collapsing on her desk after the strenuous shift in Italys gruelling battle against Coronavirus. Now- there are increasing concerns on how long small hospitals in rural areas of the South will manage to cope with the emerging hotspots. This is further aggravated by the significant proportion of older people living in these so called regions of emigration- which will more aggressively put those hospitals under pressure.  While doing my best to be of help with the emergency here in the UK- I have also decided to try and do a little something to help hospitals back home to save people. I would like to ask you to help San Carlo Hospital (South Italy) with a little donation to be used at the hospital discretion to cover their most urgent needs.  \"\"We are waves of the same sea- leaves of the same tree- flowers of the same garden\"\"  Valerio Imperatore",

   "description": "This is a fundraiser for the Emergency Medical Homeless Shelter in Worcester- Massachusetts in response to COVID-19. The shelter will house homeless people who are awaiting COVID-19 test results in addition to homeless people who test + for COVID-19- both who don't require hospital level of care but have no home to self quarantine in (there are separate areas for each group).  This shelter is essential in slowing the timeline of COVID-19 hitting the shelter system- preventing Worcester hospitals from becoming overwhelmed- and ultimately flattening the curve.  The shelter is to go live at 1PM on Saturday 3/28/2020.     The funds from this fundraiser will aid in supplies for the shelter and residents of the shelter in addition to necessary medical supplies. It is essential to keep the shelter running as long as they are dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak in Worcester- MA.  My Brother Adam Bliss is a Nurse Practitioner at Family Health Center Worcester- Homeless Outreach and Advocacy Program. His colleagues Dr. Erik Garcia- Danielle Lariviere- Stephanie Connors NP- Dr. Mary Flynn and Noreen Johnson-Smith have been working with the City of Worcester to get this shelter up and running. My brother and his colleagues- UMass Family Medicine Residents- Community healthcare volunteers- and others will aid in staffing the shelter. UMass Medical Center and St. V's have been able to aid in logistical support.  Please consider donating to this very important cause and help my brother and his colleagues care for a very vulnerable population who are at high risk during the height of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

   "description": "I am working to help fundraise money for the families of my students who are financially affected by the COVID19 pandemic. I am a 3rd grade teacher in a Title One school in SFUSD. During this time of uncertainty and financial strain many of my students' families are struggling financially as their jobs have been suspended- schools have been cancelled- and rent and other necessities are placing strain on them. I feel it is my duty to try to assist these families in their time of need. I believe this distribution of funds will most likely look different depending on the amount of money earned in GoFundMe;   Tier 1 ($2000) : With your gracious donation I will assist all families with Safeway gift cards to make sure that families are able to stay healthy and well. We are working as a school to provide 13 students' families with a $150 gift card for each family. This will be based off of the highest need at the school at this time.   Tier 2 ($4000) : I would be able to reach out to other teachers in my community to distribute more gift cards to the greater population. We are currently compiling information about families financial and sustainable needs at this time and will be able to support families with food- household essentials- and internet access during remote school learning.   Tier 3 ($6000+) : With more money we will be able to reach more families within the communities! I will work with other teachers and my principal to bring financial support to families most in crisis at this moment. We are currently working on figuring out if we can get electronic devices for students who do not currently have one in their home. With your generous donation we will be able to supply some families with electronic devices so they will be able to keep up with their studies and education at home. Bringing electronic devices to students will also help to combat boredom many students face at this time of uncertainty.  I have already done some fundraising and have been able to give some gift cards to families and they have told me how much of a difference they have made in their lives. Most of my students live in single guardianship households who sometimes work up to three jobs to try to make ends meet. Some of my students live in transitional housing- newly provided by the state. With the imminent news of further closures and school shut downs the fear and worry have set in that there is a possibility that families will no longer be able to make rent among other things. The students at my school who participate in the free lunch program usually don't eat lunch because they don't like the selections provided by the district. Even though there is free food distributed by the district- I know that my families are not taking advantage of it because of the selections being minimal. With your help- I will work to directly support families in most need at this time. While in this time of need- gathering around the table for a home cooked meal and spending time with family without the worry of where your next meal will come from will make all the difference. Please consider helping the community and giving directly to families in most need at this time. Thank you for reading!",

Many young migrants are currently returning from their jobs in Thailand to their home villages on Kulen- to avoid getting stuck while the Thai-Cambodian border is closed.   These young people returning to their family households are likely to be carriers of coronavirus from passing through large cities and using public transportation.    Their homes on Kulen Mountain often do not have any soap and are multigenerational with elderly grandparents.   Because of this- we anticipate a quick and overwhelming spread of Covid-19 through the 10 villages on Kulen. These villages are very remote and do not have easy access to advanced medical care. They also have a high population of elders and chronically ill individuals.   One small but very determined health center services the entire mountain- and they have requested our help with buying more soap- gloves- and face masks in preparation for the local coronavirus outbreak.   All proceeds from this fundraiser will go towards buying bars of soap for all households on Kulen (around 4-600 people total) and provide the local health center with all the supplies they need to fight this global pandemic.    Who are we? We're a group of foreign and Cambodian researchers and photographers who have worked on Phnom Kulen over many years. We know members of the local community on Kulen well and are deeply invested in the community's health and wellbeing. One project has been an  Elders of Cambodia page on Facebook- highlighting the life stories of elders from Phnom Kulen.  Please donate what you can and share this link widely!

After experimenting with some of the available 3D Printer designs- we realized that the time it took to create a mask wasnt efficient. We took the concept back to the drawing board and started fresh. Our new design allows us to manufacturer dozens of shields in a matter of minutes using the CNC lasers we use for our custom automotive interior installations.  Car stereo shops and more around North America have already manufactured and delivered more than a thousand masks to Doctors- hospital staff- EMTs- Police and Firefighters in just a few days. We are donating our time and our equipment to the cause. We would appreciate your support for the cost of the materials.  Money collected through this fundraiser will be distributed to shops that can source materials quickly and reliably. We are not adding any overhead expenses- and every penny will go towards making laser-cut face shields to keep frontline workers safe and help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.  We will continue to manufacture and donate these shields as long as we can continue to get materials.

   "description": "Last year at this time we were working at the border with Al Otro Lado (\"\"AOL\"\") to prepare and support migrants for their Asylum Credible Fear Interviews. At the time- there were approximately 2-500 migrants living in squalor in Tijuana waiting for their interviews. As a result of the \"\"Stay in Mexico\"\" policy- that number has jumped to 15-000 in Tijuana alone. Many of these people- including families- have no money- food or even a tent. When COVID-19 hits it will be devastating.   In response to the threat posed by COVID-19 to this vunerable population- AOL started a Humanitarian Migrant Fund. We were very impressed with AOL and the people we helped- and want to do what ever we can to support AOL's Humanitarian Migrant Fund.  The COVID-19 Humanitarian Migrant Fund will provide emergency funds to migrant families impacted by US government policies including asylum seekers- deportees- and migrants who are currently stuck in refugee camps and shelters without access to medical care and basic necessities. The fund will support AOL and key frontline serving organizations to cover unexpected costs due to unforeseen humanitarian impacts of the ongoing pandemic.  Since its adoption last year- Remain in Mexico has forced close to 65-000 asylum seekers and migrants to wait in border cities under grossly dangerous border cities to have their case heard before a US judge. Many families and migrants live in shelters or on the streets- with little to no access to healthcare- financial and social support and during this pandemic- we know the consequences of this will be beyond description.  The migrant humanitarian fund will directly support temporary emergency shelter and housing- food and nutrition care- medicine- diapers- formula- cleaning supplies- basic survival necessities- and phone and internet costs to help migrants communicate.  We must move swiftly and strategically to protect the health and safety of immigrant families amid COVID-19!  Thank you- Francine and Allison",

   "title": "Help Strengthen Our Senior Pop Against Covid19",
   "description": "Amid a coronavirus Pandemic in the United States and across the world- Covid-19 does appear to affect seniors worse than younger generations as a whole. Preliminary data suggest people who are in there 60s and older might be more susceptible to Covid-19. There is no question that our bodies do change over time. All the more reason to take very good care of ourselves as we age.  However- senior citizens having to fight off or fortify their bodies from contracting Covid-19 isnt the only thing they are having to worry about. As each day goes by and more senior lives are claimed by the Covid-19 virus- as the media reports- younger generations have begun to discriminate- demean and persecute our mature population- confusing age with doom.   Reactions by younger generations towards the Covid-19 virus are becoming discriminatory against someones age. Comments such as well he died because he was old or its a an old persons disease only desensitizes and devalues the worth of someones life. Covid-19 has given rise to an already existing problem in our society- Ageism.  To just assume that those who are 60 years and older are doomed is incorrect and discriminatory. Lets try to be a a little more sensitive and careful in how we choose to define the virus and the damaging emotional and psychological distress we can be causing our more mature population by singling them out based on solely their age. Derogatory comments in the mist of the Cororonavirus Pandemic unfortunately depicts the image of our senior members of our society as expandable- unworthy- undervalued and unaccounted for. We each have a responsibility during these difficult and worrisome times to be careful to not label- discard or define a certain generation as unworthy just because of their age.  Instead we need to rally together in making sure that our needy low income mature generations have the basic food supplies to help fight the Coronavirus Pandemic. Low income seniors usually find themselves having to make a decision between paying their electric bill or their medications. Some find themselves abandoned by their family members and have no transportation or access to food. It is during these times- especially- when these low income seniors need us to make sure they are receiving basic food supplies! And we can help.  Any donations you find in your heart to give will be used to buy food supplies and will be directly donated to low income senior buildings throughout South Florida. Basic food supplies would be items such as oatmeal- milk- frozen fruits and vegetables- pastas- water- cereals- canned items- soap- toilet paper etc. Items that will allow them to stay home and be nourished for approximately the next 2 weeks. In general low income seniors depend on food pantries and other community food distribution centers where they receive in most cases there one meal a day. With those centers now closed- how are they able to eat- let alone pay for it under these stressful and trying times?   The answer...They can't. Most find themselves at home wondering what they will eat the next day or and some will go without a food for a day. This endangers their ability to form a strong immune system and in turn weakens their body making them more prone to COVID19.  But we can help! Any donations will be used to buy these food items and distributed to low income senior buildings. Together we can help save lives and more importantly let our senior community know that they are a generation not forgotten and one that together is worth fighting for!",

   "description": "Brian Taphouse is Shiawassee's first confirmed covid-19 patient. Please support him and his family during this time of need.  Brian came down with a bad fever on Wednesday March 18th and received a Covid-19 test from Memorial Hospital on the 21st. Tests at Memorial are taking 7-10 days to come back and he was sent home to quarantine for 14 days. By Sunday night Brian was admitted to Memorial with suspected pneumonia. By 9:30 Monday morning he was put under and placed on ventilator. By Tuesday morning Brian was fighting for his life. The wonderful doctors and nurses were able stabilize Brian so that he could be flown to UofM where they have an ECMO machine. Once arriving at UofM Brian has been in stable condition and as of right now does not need to be placed on the ECMO machine. He is still very ill and needs all your thoughts and prayers.  Brian and Kristi have 2 beautiful girls Brianna (6) and Kalyn (2) aka \"\"\"\"Kentucky Jane\"\"\"\".  Kristi and his little girls are desperately awaiting the day they can see him again and have him home in their lives again.   We are asking for your help to help offset Brian's lost wages and medical care during this stressful time. Brian is the sole earner in the family and owns his own cleaning business Touch of Class Too as well as an employee of Touch of Class. In today's world there is no idea how long the business will be out of work. All of the funds will be directed to his wife Kristi to keep the lights on and children fed as well as paying for the treatment that Brian is receiving.  Thank you for taking the time to support this lovely family.  We will continue to update this page with Brian's condition.",

It appears everyone is on quarantine until after my rent is due. My rent is $1200.00 a month and I am seeking assistance with paying my health insurance premium in case I get sick. That's an easy one - $124.00. I need some emergency assistance paying the bills and keeping a roof over my head. I don't want to get so far behind that I will not be able to catch up.

The Public Health England briefing states: As many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months- and up to 15% (7.9m people) may require hospitalisation and the NHS currently cannot support these numbers which sadly means that those who are the most vulnerable will be killed by the virus.  People over 60- and especially over 80- are particularly vulnerable to severe or fatal infection. As of right now- time is crucial in making sure that those who fall within these categories are kept safe.  Our main focus will be to get a team together as soon as possible to protect the elderly by reducing the rate at which the Coronavirus spreads to them- your donation will be spent on:   1. Touring the country to provide them with emergency hygiene parcels at these times of shortage containing SOAP- SHAMPOO- BODY WASH- TOILET PAPER- HAND SANITISER and HAND WASH.    2. Providing them with food packages that contain none perishable foods such as CANNED GOODS- PASTA- RICE.SUGAR- TEA AND CEREALS to name a few.    3. Have someone speak to them regularly at times of isolation to make sure that they don't feel lonely and that their mental health is also being looked after.   With your support- we can make this journey as easy as possible for them and help save the lives of thousands of people so in future when we look back we can truly say to ourselves that we did something for those that felt helpless.

   "title": "COVID-19 Relief Fund for Tattoo Collective",
   "description": "We are setting up this GoFundMe to support the artists of a currently unnamed tattoo collective.  Our collective is made up of the following artists:  Albie (@ albiemakestattoos ) Chichi (@ bestnailsclub ) Emma (@ thorn_pokes ) Lolli (@ lollipoptattoos ) MKNZ (@ ruffenough  ) Roache (@ xroache ) Ursula (@ ursamajortattoo ) Adj (@ adjy_baby ) (shop manager)   Our group is comprised of artists from marginalized identities: queer- black- PoC- fat- femme- neurodivergent- and/or non-binary.  Our group is also comprised of people with privileged identities: white- cisgender- abled- thin- and/or straight.   We are some of the artists formerly associated with Valentines Tattoo in Seattle- WA.   In January- Valentines Tattoo was dissolved as a result of unresolved internal conflict- and a desire to create a worker-owned collective. The group of us have remained united throughout this process in the pursuit of opening a new shop in alignment of our shared values.   (A thorough statement about this process can be found on our instagram account:  @currentlyunnamedtattoo)     In February- we signed a lease on a new space and have been excitedly working on the build-out. During the dissolution of Valentines and the search for a new space- we lost work and individually invested our savings into this new collective venture. Setting up our new space included: some interior remodeling- putting in new floors- replacing old appliances- setting up licensing- and insurance policies.         Just as we were rounding the corner on being able to open the shop for business- we were- like so many other small businesses in our community- put on an indefinite hold due to current COVID-19 crisis.   This has been a stressful setback as most of us had already been working very little or not at all for the past two months. We are now daunted with the task of having to pay our home rents and the rent on our new space that we haven't yet been able to work in. As sole proprietors- we are also ineligible for collecting unemployment.   Due to the close person-to-person contact necessary with our jobs- it is unclear when we will be able to work again- even if/when some businesses are re-opening with trepidation.   We recognize that we are extremely fortunate to have visibility and support within our communities. So many folks have reached out asking how they can help us in this time. Thank you for the encouragement to seek out support and to stay grounded in our vision for a new space that we will hopefully be able to open in the future.     To be clear:    Raising these funds does not guarantee that conditions will allow us to keep the shop open. We are trying to be realistic in the face of an unprecedented crisis. We are fundraising to hang onto the lease as long as we can and to support ourselves individually through the next few months.    We are also targeting this fundraiser to folks who are able to work from home- have financial security- or for whatever reason feel in a comfortable place to contribute.    We know that there are many in our community who are in need of financial assistance right now. We also recognize that our visibility as a group gives us the traction to promote this campaign widely.    Any funds generated by this campaign that exceed our needs for our shop rent/bills and immediate basic living needs for each artist will be redistributed to people greatly impacted by COVID-19 in our community.   Please take care of yourselves and each other.   ----     Breakdown of goal:      New Shop Rent:  $2800/month (factoring two months currently)  Individual Artist Relief:  $600/month per member (8 people) (factoring two months currently)",

Helping people in Wuhan- the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak to contain the spread of the epidemic is helping ourselves.  A plague at such scale would be disastrous for any city in the world. All hospitals in Wuhan reported low stock on medical supplies as they are experiencing an unprecedented patients intake each day.  Frontline healthcare professionals and first responders- amidst the lunar New Year holiday- are working 24/7 to treat the sick- save lives and bring this outbreak under control. They skip meals and washroom breaks in order to save on disposal of protective coveralls.  The emerging- rapidly evolving situation touches the hearts of billions of people worldwide.  This coronavirus relief campaign aims to provide desperately needed medical supplies such as masks- hazmat suits and gloves to the frontline healthcare workers and hospitals in Wuhan- to help prevent the spread of the virus.  To date- 40-000 pairs of gloves and 10-000 isolation gowns are en route to Wuhan. Protective goggles- impact-proof masks and hazmat suits worth $25-000 are being purchased.

   "description": " The Puget Sound community has held and nurtured us for years. The Puget Sound has so far been hard hit by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This scary and tragic time has a lot of people staying close to home in order to try to help prevent the spread of this virus that can be devastating to our elderly- disabled- and medically compromised friends and neighbors.   The widespread cancellation of small business-like Uber drivers- cleaning services- and cooking services has had a disproportionate impact on the community - especially those who rely on daily pay checks to pay their bills. Cleaning crew- Cooking Service Crew- and Uber drivers; all of these peoples jobs rely on people showing up or they go to someones home.   Due to stay home policy- Uber drivers are without any passengers and every household has denied any cleaning or cooking services for several months in future. The cancellation may continue to grow. The entire income of these people often in the service industry which is the industry that is being hit hard.   So- if you love your community- and you have the resources to- please consider pitching in to the relief fund. If you are familiar with similar fundraisers- you know that this money goes directly to people in the Puget Sound area in need.  This fund is aimed at helping those in the Puget Sound community who have been financially impacted by cancellations of household services due to COVID-19. Depending on funding levels and number of requests- priority may be given to people from communities that have been historically and systemically economically disadvantaged in the Puget Sound Area. But we will try to help as many with need as we can as long as we have funds. We will basically keep going until we run out of money or this crisis ends - whichever comes sooner.   Where your funds go : 100% of these funds will go to who have lost income due to cancellations and work stoppage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is emergency funding to help Uber Drivers- Cleaning Crews- and Cooking Crew in need with rent- food- utilities- and medical needs. The amount given to each is determined based on how many funds we receive- how much have lost due to cancellations- and how many apply. We use these factors to calculate what percentage of each individual request we can pay each individual. We are currently giving a minimum of $500 and a maximum of $5000 to each family.   How Funds will get to the individuals: We will send funds to the mailing address- PayPal or Zelle indicated in the application. We've partnered with  API Chaya  and others shown in the \"\"Team\"\" below to serve as an accountability and oversight partner.   More overseer will be added as they volunteer.",

We will donate funds to our staff first to make sure they have support.   For anyone who donates $500 or more- we will offer a 2-hour private cocktail class taught by Isaac Shumway for up to 5 guests. For every $100 above the $500 donation- you can add one person- up to 10 people max per class. We will set a mutually agreeable date when we can all safely gather again.  If you are interested in the California Beverage Academy cocktail classes and are able to donate $500 or more please email us at  info@californiagoldbar.com   to schedule a date and go over event details.

The institution currently provides shelter- food- education and medical care to 35 children- as well as psychological support and lots of love and care. Most of children come from extremely complicated backgrounds- some being orphans- others having been victims of all different types of abuse- and they were placed in the Wanalea Children's Home by the District Children's Office as they were in urgent need of protection and care.  Besides their basic needs- the children find in our Home the Family they have lost or never had. They live as brothers and sisters under the caring guidance of our House Mothers who are mainly qualified social workers and child care providers.  The world is now facing a very difficult period of uncertainty. On the 13 of March- the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Kenya. The following day two more cases were confirmed. On the 15 of March- President Kenyatta closed the borders of the country to all foreigners coming from areas affected by the pandemic- except for citizens and residents. He also ordered the immediate closure of all learning institutions and suspended all public events in order to avoid large gatherings of people. There are now 4 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and many other suspected cases still waiting for confirmation.These are drastic but necessary measures if we want to avoid an humanitarian catastrophe. The Kenyan health care system is far from being ready and able to handle a crisis of these dimensions and has already began showing signs of that incapacity.  At the Wanalea Children's Home- we have already started taking action and implementing the preventive measures recommended by the World Health Organization. We have reinforced hygiene procedures and protocols- we have suspended all volunteer programs and visits to the institution- and we are closely monitoring the children- especially the ones who have preexisting conditions that compromise their immune systems.  We are facing some very difficult times ahead of us- and only by showing love- care and solidarity with each other will we be able to beat this pandemic that has literally turned our lives upside down. We know we are all anxious and nervous- but this is the time to be there for each other.  We need your help to fight this pandemic by protecting our children- and others- and making sure they don't lack any basic needs during this period of hardship. We would like to create an emergency fund of 6-000 Euros to enable us to properly respond to this global crisis. This will enable us to purchase sanitizing and disinfectant products- as well as antibacterial soaps- gloves and masks- and to create a stock of medicines and food in case the situation worsens and there is scarcity.  Please help us protect our children- who are already so vulnerable- from this terrible virus!  Thank you!

   "description": "During a challenging and unprecedented time of preparation for and response to the COVID-19 pandemic- and during a unique government order to shelter in place- our most vulnerable patient populations are most at risk. The definition- per the World Bank- of vulnerability from a medico-social perspective is: high probability of a negative outcome- or an unexpected welfare loss above a socially accepted norm- which results from risky or uncertain events- and the lack of appropriate means to deal with them. It is at such times that we- as medical professionals- have specific opportunities to look at care for the whole person- and to promote health for the populations we serve- while also showing hope and love.  We propose a coordinated residency/faculty response- directed by ongoing communication of needs from community partners. At this time- shelters and community partners served include: Dream Center- Peoria Rescue Ministries- Friendship House- Sophias Kitchen- Salvation Army- St. Augustine Manor- and many more. A specific current need communicated by OSF Faith Community Team members is that there is a need for food delivery to some of our more at-risk- patients in the high risk zip codes we serve. Shelters planning for alternative quarantine sites need supplies for these sites- as well.  From Mother Teresa: Today- if we have no peace- it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other... If we would only defend these defenseless people with food- shelter- and clothing- I think the world would be a happier place. The poor must know that we love them- that they are wanted. We are concerned with how to get this message of love and compassion across.   This can be our message of love and compassion to the populations we serve- because ultimately- we all belong to each other.",

   "description": "Hi everyone- we are Razmik and David- two Armenian friends who are worried as much as any other Armenian for current global situation due to the Coronavirus named as COVID-19.  As you can see- the virus is spreading in an unprecedented velocity. One month ago no one would even think that it will go out of control and affect so many people around the world. First- China was affected badly. Now- Europe is considered a new epidemic center for this virus. Tomorrow who knows?   So far there are already many confirmed cases (although for Armenia its already a big number) and much more people in quarantine (more info on :   https://ncdc.am/coronavirus/current-situation/  ). In spite everyone hopes for the best- no one knows how the things will go. The situation may be worse- before it gets better. For this we have to be ready.   Armenia is a small country and it is able to prevent the spread of the virus. Unfortunately- late response from some European countries made the situation so bad that now medics are to choose who should live and who shouldnt- based on their age or health conditions.    We should not go in this way. We will not go in this way. We will not be in an undesirable situation. We choose to protect all our people either old or sick. We do not have people to lose.  And we do believe the same ideas share our government.   For the moment Razmik is in quarantine in Spain and can see the huge difference between how the governments treat the situation and handle quarantines. So far Armenia and Armenian government is doing much better on this than any other European country with more robust healthcare system. Armenia will also fight this virus in a more efficient way. So lets help to our government and people in this situation.    Taking as references South Korea and China- which used mass testing as an important step for battling the virus- and the current availability of rapid tests (up to 15 minutes) we want to provide resources for enough tests for Armenia. With our basic estimations there might be a need of at least 10-000 tests soon.   If the things go in a worse scenario- we will need more respiratory systems for the people in ICUs.   Masks- gloves- sanitisers and other protective materials for citizens and healthcare workers have become more expensive everywhere and many cannot afford it anymore- so we want be sure that these primarily needed goods are enough for whoever needs it (prioritising especially healthcare workers- elderly people and the families with children).   We will organize and provide care and any type of resources for the people in need.   Since elderly people are more vulnerable to any unpredictable situation- we want to help them with utility payments such as gas- electricity- water etc.   By this step we want to encourage our people and government officials to do their best to prevent the spreading of the virus and take care of consequences in any scenario.   Please join us in becoming a part of the solution and lets get our homeland free of this virus!",

Die Auswirkungen der Schlieungen sind jedoch für die Mehrheit der Beschäftigten   Selbstständigen in der Gastronomie finanziell verheerend.   Wir haben bis heute auf die ersehnte Hilfe von der Bundesregierung gehofft- mussten jedoch ernüchternd feststellen- dass die neu beschlossenen Soforthilfen nur für Unternehmen über 10 Angestellten gelten . Alles was darüber liegt- soll aller Voraussicht tatsächlich auf Kredite zurückgreifen.  Aus diesem Grund haben wir uns zu diesem Schritt hier entschlossen.    Ablauf dieser Kampagne:    Alle Spender erhalten einen Verzehrgutschein für unser Restaurant über die gleiche gespendete Summe.   Die Gutscheine werden nach Spendeneingang sofort per E-Mail oder auf dem Postweg übersendet!    Als Highlight dieser Kampangne werden wir-fallls das Spendenziel von 10.000 Euro erreicht wird - 1.000 Euro an Wupertaler Krankenhäuser selber spenden.

Following the order issued on 3/23/2020 by Governor Baker for all non-essential businesses to cease operations- thru 4/7/2020- Funway Bark Dog Daycare in Marlborough MA joins the list of millions of small businesses across the globe facing severe economic hardship because of the Coronavirus outbreak.  We evaluated all of the options- and feel the best way to support us during this time would be to contribute to the Funway Bark Staff   Operational Expense Covid 19 Emergency Relief Fund.  While we are closed- the donated funds will go directly to:  1. Paying staff while we are closed 2. Assisting with fixed operational expenses  Upon the order being lifted by the state of MA- any excess funds collected during this time will be donated to a local non-profit animal based charity.",

   "description": "Fighting for his life-COVID-19 patient  John Giarratano- 42- was experiencing a fever and labored breathing when he drove himself to the ER one early morning. He was admitted into the hospital on Friday- 13th- 2020- diagnosed with pneumonia and was being treated. Little did anyone know that COVID-19 was ferociously attacking his lungs- his breathing became more labored with every day that passed- and he was in critical condition by Monday 16th.   John is a charismatic- loving- funny- and a compassionate man that works as a freelance television producer. He was waiting for his 90 day period to be eligible for insurance coverage to be over. However- he never got to that 90 day mark and didn't have insurance when this nightmare began with COVID-19 pandemic.  Critical care patients needs continual care around the clock- and without insurance- and with hospital costs averaging around $10-000 per day- medical costs are growing. If you would like to assist with this financial burden- any donations would be greatly appreciated. All funds raised will go directly to John's medical costs and related recovery treatment. John and his partner- Brian Zupanick- appreciate the outpouring of love- prayers- and support during this difficult time. Everyone is holding onto the hope that John will continue to fight for his life.    https://www.pix11.com/news/coronavirus/he-kept-getting-worse-one-queens-mans-battle-against-coronavirus",

   "description": "As I am sure you know- The Golden Goose- along with all of the other bars in Austin- has been closed by the City due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Best case scenario- we will be open after May 1.  First of all- WE ALREADY MISS YOU! You- our regulars- our weekend visitors- our out of town wanderers- Y'all are honestly the best crowd we could dream of. (Believe me I've worked some nightmares.)  These next few weeks (possibly months) are going to be scary for us. Not only are we worried about our health and the health of our loved ones- we all just lost our income.   Imagine that- no paycheck till...dunno.  Abby- Alyssa- Brenna- Eric- Ken- Peggy- Rob- Sean- and Tamara are going to be relying on your help to get through this. All of the money we raise goes directly to them.  You have been so generous to us already and we need you to keep it up!  Hoping for the best and we cant wait to see your faces again.  Lana",
