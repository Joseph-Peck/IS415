            "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic is something that has led to extreme panic and suffering across not only Canada, but the world. Many have died, and countless are left panicked at home unsure of whether or not they have contracted the virus. Due to global panic, the economy is taking a hit and people across the world have been forced to cancel events as a result of social distancing.   While the Canadian government is doing their best to slow the spread of COVID-19, we still feel the effects every day. Greater Vancouver and the Lower Mainland have been ravaged by empty stores and a fear of social contact. As a result of new social distancing recommendations put forth by the World Health Organization and the BC government, many are stuck in their houses and cannot access essential goods and services that they need to live. The elderly need help with their groceries, the immunocompromised need help with daily errands, and the general population needs information that is vital to keep them safe. Many people simply need a helping hand. Someone to drive out and grab them something. Someone to give them information about how to stay clean and to avoid contracting the virus. Others just need somebody to talk to.  There are currently many groups in and around the Greater Vancouver and Lower Mainland community, but few know about these services and they will be better off collaborating to maximize their impacts. This fundraiser is aimed at collecting funds to cover groceries and to pay for errands that people need to have done while in quarantine (if needed), to make it easier for volunteers to get out and help, to create vital informational materials, and to fund care homes as well as homeless shelters.  The first step is to create a website that will include information, a sign up for those who need help and those who are able to give help, and volunteer opportunities for anyone who is able to come out during this tumultuous time. After, the money will be used to further fund initiatives that will secure goods for the homeless, help the immunodeficient, and fund other impactful programs. This platform will also allow various groups and organizations that are working towards the same goal to come together.   Another important step is to ensure that people who are feeling symptoms do not leave their homes. This means that they will need people to help them run their errands and to get equipment in order to sustain themselves. We can help contain this virus if we all work together.  If you‚Äö√Ñ√¥d like more information as to where your money will be going, or how you can help in other ways, please reach out and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll get back to you ASAP.  Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s unite to fight this emergency, and let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s unite to fight COVID-19.",

            "description": "Die Coronakrise und der damit verbundene Shutdown in Jena und ganz Deutschland trifft wirtschaftlich am schwersten die kleinen. Freiberufler und Selbstst‚àö¬ßndige, K‚àö¬∫nstler und Musiker, kleine L‚àö¬ßden ohne weitere Mitarbeiter und ohne M‚àö‚àÇglichkeit (Stand 16.03.2020) staatliche Hilfen wie zum Beispiel Kurzarbeitsgeld zu beziehen.  Viele der Betroffenen machen sich aktuell durch den immensen Wegfall von Einnahmen zurecht Sorgen um ihre Existenz, da es f‚àö¬∫r sie aktuell keine M‚àö‚àÇglichkeit gibt aktiv f‚àö¬∫r den Lebensunterhalt zu sorgen.  Da wir uns in einer Ausnahmesituation befinden, die uns alle gleicherma‚àö√ºen trifft, m‚àö‚àÇchte ich gerne hiermit einen Nachbarschaftshilfe Fond ins Leben rufen, der lokal in Jena diejenigen unterst‚àö¬∫tzt, die durch den Shutdown in finanzielle Schwierigkeiten geraten sind und erstmal nicht auf staatliche Hilfe bauen k‚àö‚àÇnnen.  Da es mich pers‚àö‚àÇnlich als Selbstst‚àö¬ßndigen auch treffen kann, weiss ich um die generelle aktuelle Unsicherheit und m‚àö‚àÇchte da etwas dagegen unternehmen, wo ich etwas bewegen kann, auf lokaler Ebene.  Wir k‚àö‚àÇnnen nicht alle Probleme l‚àö‚àÇsen, aber wir k‚àö‚àÇnnen denen, die aktuell auf sich alleine gestellt sind, ein paar Kopfschmerzen nehmen. Daf‚àö¬∫r soll das Geld aus dieser Kampagne verwendet werden.  Falls ihr zu den Leuten geh‚àö‚àÇrt, die dringend Hilfe ben‚àö‚àÇtigen, wendet euch an mich.  Es ist an der Zeit zusammenzuhalten und uns um unsere Stadt zu k‚àö¬∫mmern.  0774X LOCAL HEROES  Sebastian Heering Downtown Jena",

I am in the same boat as many small businesses,¬¨‚Ä† where i rely on our daily business to support the horses and pay the bills that keep the ranch going. As you guys know, If I can't do business,teaching lessons etc, I don't get paid.¬¨‚Ä†Even with all the craziness,¬¨‚Ä† the ranch has to operate as normal for the horses sake! They still will need to have to have their feet done by our farrier, and need their usual feed and supplements, and routine vet care.¬¨‚Ä† In turn, me purchasing our feed and paying our farrier supports other small businesses.¬¨‚Ä†If anyone has a favourite Tall Oaks horse, this is where you can help support them ! $40 will pay for a horses feet¬¨‚Ä† to be trimmed by our wonderful farrier,(Elfta Hilzman) and helps keep her business going too.$17 buys a bale of hay and supports our feed store which is an amazing family owned small business that we have purchased from for years.¬¨‚Ä†Any money we raise that is not used for Ranch expenses during this time will be payed forward, to another small business that needs it!It has also come my attention that some of our boarders have lost jobs, or had hours drastically reduced, so if we can raise enough I would love to help them out with some of their horses essential costs also. I cant wait to have everyone back to the ranch once this all is over.¬¨‚Ä† We have an amazing community that we are proud to be a part of!Thank you so much for supporting small businesses!",

Their current campaign is accepting applicants for industry workers who've been diagnosed with Covid-19. Here are some additional ideas that are relevant:* bus passes/Tarc cards* donations to single-parent organizations* financial literacy webinar (looking for someone to donate their time for this)* pet food bank* donated goods and services with auctions on a FB Live Watch Party to generate more contributionsThis is a mission in progress!#bourbontourism",

            "description": "Hi friends! Boho Yoga is a small, community based yoga school in McMinnville, OR. Started in 2017 by Rose Schneider   Lesley Anderson, Boho Yoga has become a staple in our small community for yoga, meditation   alternative wellness resources. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are in need of #SmallBusinessRelief from our community in order to survive   thrive.  In February 2020, Boho Yoga expanded their studio with the addition of a new 1000 sq/ft \"\"Boho Annex\"\". This space was intended to expand our current offerings and help support two other local businesses offering Tai Chi   martial arts (Boreal Wellness), and fun, fast paced movement classes¬¨‚Ä† (Fresh Air Movement).¬¨‚Ä†  In early March, Boho Yoga decided to reduce the number of classes being offered and limit the number of students per class in order to maintain social distancing recommendations. After a short period of time, Rose   Lesley made the very tough decision to shut the doors and cancel remaining in-person classes until further notice.¬¨‚Ä† Although the State of Oregon did not require us to shut or doors until very recently, we knew we could not keep our doors open   our classes going with the information we received about the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.¬¨‚Ä†  Our student's health and well-being is our top priority.¬¨‚Ä†  Since closing the doors, Lesley   Rose have been working hard on updating their business model, learning new skills, and researching how best to bring more yoga into the home's of their students.  Rose   Lesley are optimistic about the opportunities that increasing virtual offerings could have for their classes, their privates, their events and their 200-hour Yoga Alliance Certified yoga teacher training program,¬¨‚Ä† now and for many years to come.¬¨‚Ä†   Boho Yoga has been providing free yoga   meditation classes everyday from their Instagram account since the beginning of March and will be launching their first filmed series of classes, online privates, and a Pro web-series on in-depth yoga topics on April 1st. (Side note: April 1st is Boho Yoga's 3 year anniversary!).  Lesley and Rose were able to work with their landlord on rent deferral, and so far they have been able to pay all their bills, but with the loss of income from in-person classes   sub leasing contracts, Boho Yoga needs financial community support to survive the next several months.¬¨‚Ä†  If we are able to reach our goal of $5,000 we will not only be able to survive, but thrive. Over $3,000 of this will go directly to paying rent   utilities and the remaining $2,000 will allow us to purchase a (gently used) desktop computer for editing, a high quality camera for filming, a small microphone system, and enough funds to bring back (at least) two additional teachers to help serve our community's yoga needs.¬¨‚Ä†  We believe in the power of yoga to help heal the mind, body   spirit and couldn't be more proud of this amazing community in Yamhill County that we are a part of. We are in this together.   Thank you so much for your support   encouragement.¬¨‚Ä† Stay well friends   keep taking care of each other. We love you. May the force be with you.¬¨‚Ä† Xo Boho Yoga Co-Founders, Rose Schneider   Lesley Ramaa Anderson   www.bohoyogastudio.com ¬¨‚Ä† Facebook: www.facebook.com/bohoyogastudio Instagram: @bohoyogastudio  P.s. Thanks to the #SmallBusinessRelief fund from GoFundMe, if Boho Yoga is able to raise  $500 or more , they will grant us a matching $500. This will be extremely helpful to us. Thank you for supporting small business!",

It has led to more than 210 deaths so far (as of 1/30/20) with no cure, and it is very hard to detect with symptoms largely resembling the common cold, further contributing to the danger that it presents. 8,100 cases have been confirmed in mainland China, and the virus continues to spread globally. In WuHan, China, where the virus started, there has been a shortage of medical supplies for those in need, further worsening the situation.   We are determined to raise as much money as possible, setting a starting goal of $5000, to buy medical supplies such as face masks, goggles, and gloves for the doctors and citizens who need them. Thank you so much for your support!",

            "description": "Gov. Jay Inslee is planning to announce the closure of all K-12 schools, public and private, in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties for more than a month, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.  Under the executive order, schools can hold classes until Monday, March 16. They must close by March 17 and remain closed until April 24.  Across the three counties, nearly 563,600 attend public or charter schools. Roughly 216,700 of them qualify for subsidized meals, leaving many of the 43 school districts there scrambling to plan for feeding children during an extended closure.  Students with disabilities and children experiencing homelessness also are likely to bear the brunt of long periods without schools open. For many students who don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have stable housing arrangements, school can be the one constant in their lives.  As a community we need to band together and help our children to never go without a meal. The ~1MM target covers for a meal for one child, so we have to do more. Please generously contribute.   I will be working closely with the Governer's office to make sure all funds get directed to our state for quick and appropriate distribution of funds.",

It took him a while, but I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m so very proud to see the man he has become.  We all know the path he took and the mistakes he made. I was so heartbroken that I had to let go. It was the single, most difficult decision I ever had to make in my life to walk away and let fate decide his future.  I can thankfully say today, three years later, that Shane has become the son that I can be proud of. He has held a steady job for the past three years and has led a clean and sober life. Every time I see him, the tears well up in my eyes at my pride in this young man.  The reason I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m writing this is that Shane is planning on getting married this July 22. It is not going to be an extravagant wedding, it will be held in the backyard of a family member, in the afternoon, after he‚Äö√Ñ√¥s done working.  It pains me that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not financially able to help out. I would so like to make this a special occasion for him. So, hat in hand, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m beseeching friends and family to help out, whatever you can afford, be it one dollar, or some sort of decoration or such thing. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m trying to do an island wedding and am working with what little funds I have.  I am doing a fundraising and the link is listed below. No hard feelings, whatever you can donate will be much appreciated.  Please¬¨‚Ä† donate‚Äö√Ñ¬∂thank you! And God Bless!",

            "description": "The  Actors'   Entertainers' Benevolent Fund of Queensland ¬¨‚Ä†is raising urgently needed funds to support the performing arts professionals in Queensland who are in crisis as a result of COVID-19.   The Fund is a registered charity and has been the place Queensland performing arts professionals turn when in crisis or need for over 45 years. And now more than ever, we need your support. COVID-19 is crippling our industry.   Today, there are nearly 5000 people in Queensland who identify as performing arts professionals. Hundreds have already lost¬¨‚Ä† their livelihoods , and thousands more will find themselves without income soon. This is millions of dollars in lost income, and the number will only climb.  Our goal is to support every Queensland performing arts professional effected by COVID-19, and to do that we need your help.   We aim to raise $1,250,000 as a starting point to ensure that every call for help thus far can be answered.   $50,000 may support 200 performers short term.  $100,000 could help 400.  $250,000 could help 1000.  $500,000 could help 2000.  $1,000,000 could help 4000.   $1,250,000 will help the 5000 people we know are in trouble. For now at least.   The Fund have dedicated $25,000 to kick-start this fundraiser.   If you can help, now is the time to give. No amount is too small.  Every donation of $2 or more is fully tax deductible. Together we can help support our performers in this, their time of need.",

            "description": "As we all try and cope with COVID-19 (coronavirus), there are a lot of people in New York City impacted by this new restaurant/ bar ban. Many of our neighbors are in difficult positions.    Over the past 10 years, I have worked alongside some of the greatest people in the restaurant and bar industry. Bartenders, barbacks, bussers, porters, DJs, servers, bottle service, delivery people, and much more.  Sadly a lot of them are undocumented or not even on the books at some of your favorite restaurants and bars. And it's often not by choice.  I am asking you to join me in supporting them. We want to help at least 5 businesses, and help as many people who work at these establishments. We are focusing on those who cannot get unemployment benefits because they have been off the books for three years or the bartender/ server that only gets paid in cash. Many of them are unable to work at home but still have rent and other bills to pay. This is a dire and stressful position to be in, and we shouldn't take this for granted.   As soon as we receive funds we will start highlighting   dispersing immediately.¬¨‚Ä† By donating as little as a dollar you can help pay someone's cellphone, the electric bill,¬¨‚Ä† or buy some groceries.  With the economic impacts of COVID-19 hitting New York City, it's only going to get more tough for a lot of people.  We may need to socially distance ourselves to flatten the curve of infection, but we also need to reach out and support our neighbors best we can. Luckily the internet makes that pretty easy. Donate now.¬¨‚Ä†  Let's come together like we all say we would in a time of crisis.  Thank you,  Chao¬¨‚Ä†   Chao Williams has honed his craft in the hospitality industry everywhere from Ciprianis to Mansion, and Tenjune Nightclub.

Il progetto raccoglie fondi per acquistare KIT da donare alle strutture sanitarie e mezzi mobili di soccorso che in questo modo, in pochissimo tempo, potranno valutare la sieroconversione nelle infezioni da COVID-19.  La sieroconversione ‚àö¬Æ il passaggio dallo stato di sieronegativit‚àö‚Ä† (assenza di anticorpi nel sangue) allo stato di sieropositivit‚àö‚Ä† (presenza di anticorpi nel sangue).

F‚àö¬∫r uns Gastronomen und vor allem unsere Angestellten ist es ganz besonders erdr‚àö¬∫ckend.¬¨‚Ä†  Ich wei‚àö√º, dass auch andere Branchen genau so schwer unter der aktuellen Lage zu leiden haben wie wir, jedoch bin ich zun‚àö¬ßchst einmal darauf bedacht,meinen 25 Angestellten und Ihren Familien weiterhin eine Lebensgrundlage bieten zu k‚àö‚àÇnnen. Da wir im Moment vor‚àö¬∫bergehend durch die beh‚àö‚àÇrdliche Ma‚àö√ºnahme f‚àö¬∫r einen Monat geschlossen sind, belaufen sich unsere Einnahmen z.Zt. auf 0‚Äö√á¬®.  Wir haben bis jetzt auf etwas Hilfe von der Bundes- oder Landesregierung gehofft, mussten gestern jedoch ern‚àö¬∫chternd feststellen, dass die neu beschlossenen Soforthilfen nur f‚àö¬∫r Unternehmen bis zu 10 Angestellten gEltern. Alles was dar‚àö¬∫ber liegt, soll aller Voraussicht tats‚àö¬ßchlich auf Kredite zur‚àö¬∫ckgreifen. Nur wie sollen wir diese Kredite zur‚àö¬∫ckzahlen, wenn wir kein Einkommen haben? Bitte verstehen Sie mich nicht falsch: Ich begr‚àö¬∫‚àö√ºe diese Ma‚àö√ºnahme sehr, sind doch unter unseren G‚àö¬ßsten auch eine Vielzahl an Einzel- und Kleinstunternehmer.¬¨‚Ä† Aber was ist mit uns, die mehr Leuten ‚àö¬∫ber Jahre und Jahrzehnten Arbeit geben?  Aus diesem Grund habe ich mich zu diesem Schritt entschlossen. Aber: wir wollen auch etwas daf‚àö¬∫r zur‚àö¬∫ck geben. Abgesehen davon, dass wir in unserem Eingangsbereich eine Liste unserer Unterst‚àö¬∫tzer bis zum Ende des Jahres aush‚àö¬ßngen, m‚àö‚àÇchten wir f‚àö¬∫r alle Spenden einen Gutschein ‚àö¬∫ber die gleiche Summe des Spendenbetrages  ausgeben. Wir werden nach der Aktion alle Namen, die durchihre Spende einen Gutschein bekommen, sammeln und f‚àö¬∫r jeden einen dementsprechenden Gutschein zum Abholen vorbereiten. Sollte jemand von zu weit au‚àö√ºerhalb einen Gutschein bekommen, so schreiben Sie uns einfach eine Nachricht auf Facebook. Diesen Gutschein schicken wir auch per Post. F‚àö¬∫r alle Wuppertaler: Bitte holen Sie den Gutschein unter Vorlage des Ausweises und der Spendenquittung bei uns ab, sobald wir wieder ge‚àö‚àÇffnet sind.  Bitte beachten Sie: der Gutschein kann nur ausgegeben werden, wenn Sie bei Ihrer Spende ihren Namen angeben.¬¨‚Ä†  Ich danke Ihnen von ganzem Herzen und hoffe, dass wir uns ganz bald wieder sehen.

            "description": "The Problem:    Due to the COVID-19 virus, in the coming months, projections suggest the US could have a shortfall of over 800,000 ventilators. The US is likely to need over 1 million ventilators to treat COVID-19 patients but only has around 160,000 ventilators nationwide. Currently, US manufacturers produce just 14,000 ventilators per year and some ventilator manufacturers are ramping up production by 40%, so in a year they can produce 20,000 ventilators.¬¨‚Ä† There is simply no way for current manufacturers to even put a small dent in the number of ventilators required.    The Backstory:    COVID-19 Ventilators, Inc. was formed to tackle this challenge.¬¨‚Ä† The design team has created and is building a prototype of an Emergency Ventilator, the brainchild of CEO, Tarik Yousef.¬¨‚Ä† Yousef is a Columbus, Ohio resident - an engineer by training and a small business owner, manufacturing fine furniture. Motivated by the data and the pandemic risks we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re currently facing, he pulled a team of medical, engineering, and software experts together to design a system that can be both manufactured to support Ohio‚Äö√Ñ√¥s critical hospital capacity challenges and shared for others to modify and source for their own local needs.¬¨‚Ä†   In less than two weeks, the team worked to create a system that mimics traditional ventilators, but at a much lower cost. ¬¨‚Ä† Once the initial design was complete, Yousef connected with co-founders Liz Stump and Amanat Ahmad to set up COVID-19 Ventilators, Inc. to rapidly build a partner network to secure manufacturing and production materials, processes, and facility space for the various components. The organization is currently pending approval for 501(c)(3) status.    The Solution:    The Emergency Ventilator has comparable functionality to more sophisticated models, with high precision sensors to ensure patient safety and provide real time data and a computer learning algorithm that detects changes and adjusts in real time.¬¨‚Ä† Partnering with medical professionals, Yousef has developed a product that he says is, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫one of the only emergency ventilators being developed with a proper control interface, allowing medical professionals full access to volume, pressure settings, and data monitoring, similar to traditional ventilators.‚Äö√Ñ√π    The Need:    This project is moving extremely quickly - the design process started on March 16, 2020, and a functional prototype of the Emergency Ventilator was built and is in testing in less than two weeks.¬¨‚Ä† To turn the prototype into a scalable reality that can save lives, COVID-19 Ventilators, Inc. needs funding to build a small batch of Emergency Ventilators that can be tested in real life settings as early as the week of March 23, 2020.¬¨‚Ä† The initial prototype is completing basic in-house testing, however, we need your financial contribution immediately to:   Support the initial investment costs of the prototype and non-profit set-up Complete the final components of the first prototype Build 10 additional prototypes for clinical testing and FDA approval  As we raise additional funds, all money will be invested in future Emergency Ventilator production costs.¬¨‚Ä† If funds are raised and not needed, they will be directed towards other non-profits supporting COVID-19 community needs.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†   More information and for contact information, please see our website at:  www.covid19ventilator.org",

In the current pandemic this is an asset we can lend to our community. Because of this we have worked long and hard through various PPE concepts and designs to figure out how we can do the most good with what we have.  We are making FACE SHIELDS. This design uses minimal 3D filament, and can be printed faster than other open source PPE designs that have been circulating. The headband is reusable and this design has been specifically approved of, and asked for by Emerson Hospital; they requested ‚Äö√Ñ√∫‚Äö√Ñ¬∂as many as we can make.‚Äö√Ñ√π  Challenge accepted.  We have access through one of Makers Workshop‚Äö√Ñ√¥s members to a large quantity of Petg, the clear shield component of these visors. We can cut 1 shield in about 20-40 seconds on our laser cutters, and we currently have a very large quantity of this raw material, enough to produce thousands. However, the 3D printed head pieces takes 5-7 Hours to print 2.  The Makers Workshop community is 3D Printing as many of the head bands as we can. Our printers and running nonstop, our member's printers are running nonstop, and friends in our extended network are also making as many as they can throughout the country. ¬¨‚Ä†  However, we still COULD be producing completed shields much more quickly, potentially hundreds per day, and¬¨‚Ä†we have started receiving requests from more hospitals daily.   ...so we NEED YOUR HELP.¬¨‚Ä†  Money raised here will go towards: -Shipping costs to get 3D Printed Parts to Us for Assembly -The Cost of Materials including filament and elastic, some of which are in short demand which is causing inflated prices.¬¨‚Ä† ... and other costs of business related directly to facilitating this project.¬¨‚Ä†  We are setting a low goal, but the more that we raise, the quicker we can produce for our hospitals, and the more we can produce.¬¨‚Ä†  ALSO,¬¨‚Ä†  If you have a 3D printer and are able to join the team printing parts (THE MORE THE MERRIER), please email info@makersworkshop.com to get the file and coordinate getting the parts to us so that we can assemble and deliver to Emerson Hospital, Acton Medical, and our growing list of organizations requesting them. ¬¨‚Ä†Feel free to email with any questions as well.

Those of us in the arts community and those of us who are close to the arts community know the financial pressures that have long been increasing for those in the arts - especially for artists of color.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†  Seattle has so far been the city hardest hit by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This scary and tragic¬¨‚Ä† time has a lot of people staying close to home in order to try to help prevent the spread of this virus that can be devastating to our elderly, disabled, and medically compromised friends and neighbors.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†  The widespread cancellation of group events has had a disproportionate impact on the Seattle arts community - especially those who rely on gigs to pay their bills. Creatives are people whose very existence relies on what they create and people being able to access their work. Musicians, DJ‚Äö√Ñ√¥s, independent chefs, caterers, actors, directors, writers, spoken word artists, teaching artists, all of these peoples jobs rely on people showing up for events but events are being canceled.¬¨‚Ä†  I know that so far every speaking engagement I had for the next month has been cancelled or postponed, and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m in the very rare and privileged position to be able to weather this financially. Many are not.¬¨‚Ä† We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re seeing canceled events through the end of this month and it's probably going to continue to grow. A large percentage of artists supplement their incomes with part time jobs often in the service industry which is another industry that is being hit hard.¬¨‚Ä†  So if you love Seattle art and the Seattle arts community, and you have the resources to, please consider pitching in to our relief fund. If you are familiar with similar fundraisers I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve done in the past (like for last year‚Äö√Ñ√¥s snowpocalypse), you know that this money goes directly to people in the Seattle area in need.  This fund is aimed at helping those in the greater Seattle arts community who have been financially impacted by cancellations due to COVID-19, with priority given to to BIPOC artists, transgender   nonbinary artists, and disabled artists - but we will try to help as many artists with need in Seattle as we can.  If you are an artist in need of funds,  Click Here ¬¨‚Ä† to take our survey and apply for relief.  We can get through this together.",

            "description": " The Puget Sound community has held and nurtured us for years. The Puget Sound has so far been hard hit by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This scary and tragic time has a lot of people staying close to home in order to try to help prevent the spread of this virus that can be devastating to our elderly, disabled, and medically compromised friends and neighbors.   The widespread cancellation of small business-like Uber drivers, cleaning services, and cooking services has had a disproportionate impact on the community - especially those who rely on daily pay checks to pay their bills. Cleaning crew, Cooking Service Crew, and Uber drivers; all of these people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s jobs rely on people showing up or they go to someone‚Äö√Ñ√¥s home.   Due to stay home policy, Uber drivers are without any passengers and every household has denied any cleaning or cooking services for several months in future. The cancellation may continue to grow. The entire income of these people often in the service industry which is the industry that is being hit hard.   So, if you love your community, and you have the resources to, please consider pitching in to the relief fund. If you are familiar with similar fundraisers, you know that this money goes directly to people in the Puget Sound area in need.  This fund is aimed at helping those in the Puget Sound community who have been financially impacted by cancellations of household services due to COVID-19. Depending on funding levels and number of requests, priority may be given to people from communities that have been historically and systemically economically disadvantaged in the Puget Sound Area. But we will try to help as many with need as we can as long as we have funds. We will basically keep going until we run out of money or this crisis ends - whichever comes sooner.   Where your funds go : 100% of these funds will go to who have lost income due to cancellations and work stoppage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is emergency funding to help Uber Drivers, Cleaning Crews, and Cooking Crew in need with rent, food, utilities, and medical needs. The amount given to each is determined based on how many funds we receive, how much have lost due to cancellations, and how many apply. We use these factors to calculate what percentage of each individual request we can pay each individual. We are currently giving a minimum of $500 and a maximum of $5000 to each family.   How Funds will get to the individuals: We will send funds to the mailing address, PayPal or Zelle indicated in the application. We've partnered with  API Chaya  and others shown in the \"\"Team\"\" below to serve as an accountability and oversight partner.¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†  More overseer will be added as they volunteer.",

            "description": "The current and ongoing pandemic surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a scary time. As we battle the Virus, keeping each other safe and healthy, all whilst worrying about employment security, our future and much more, we need to ensure that we are also working in solidarity to protect our communities. In Western Sydney, with Emerton shops having shut down, this has left many families and households in public housing in a very difficult position. The sick, the elderly and those without means of independent transport are left in vulnerable positions, low on basic supplies and amenities needed to survive, and will be at risk of jeopardising their health and safety by fending for themselves to obtain already scarce supplies.It has become apparent that our governments, self-fulfilling political institutions and charities remain oblivious to the struggle of people in our local communities. In upholding the traditions of mutual aid, it is upon us to do the work, for solidarity, for community self defence. Collective care is our best weapon to fight the Virus. As a collective comprised of members of the community, as well as people working in social services we have a direct understanding of which and what supplies are needed and where they need to go to be the most beneficial. We have spent our time on the ground at the forefront, door knocking and checking in on residents and families and helping with what they need far more rapidly than social services, whilst maintaining strict health and safety sanitary measures.Whilst we are absolutely grateful for the donations we have received in the form of supplies, due the uncertainty of the length of pandemic, the scarcity of spare supplies and the volume of residents we hope to help has meant this won't be sustainable in the long run. As many have contacted us offering financial donations, we have set this up as a means of helping out. No amount is too little. Let us prove to ourselves that, rather than relying on the self-fulfilling political institutions and careerist politicians, we have the capacities to care for, nurture, build and support our own communities. If not you, then who? If not now, then when?*Disclaimer*Whilst our target budget was set at a particular amount, this was purely the generic target set by GoFund me, ¬¨‚Ä†the reality is that our financial target at this point remains to be dynamic and relative to the duration of the pandemic and how many people we are able to assist in the long run.¬¨‚Ä†",

            "description": "Questa raccolta fondi servir‚àö‚Ä† per finanziare l'acquisto di strumenti necessari per contrastare l'emergenza data dall'espansione del virus COVID-19.  Molto spesso non sappiamo a chi rivolgerci per donare e per questa ragione pubblichiamo questa raccolta.   Essendo ormai stato adottato da questa splendida regione ed avendo organizzato in Sardegna molte mostre fotografiche negli anni precedenti, io sottoscritto Stefano Lotumolo, fotografo freelance, insieme alla mia ragazza Ludovica Cristofaro di Olbia e tanti altri amici Sardi abbiamo sentito il bisogno di supportare, per quanto possibile, la Sardegna.  Con Simonetta Selloni, giornalista della Nuova Sardegna, ci siamo confrontati ed abbiamo deciso che la raccolta dovesse avere come beneficiario chi si trova veramente in ¬¨‚Ä†situazioni di necessit‚àö‚Ä†.  Chiunque si stia impegnando per contenere nel miglior modo possibile questa emergenza, gli infermieri, i medici, i volontari che sono sul campo quotidianamente. Forniremo mascherine, tamponi, tutto ci‚àö‚â§ che possa essere utile per sostenerli in sicurezza, altrimenti gli ospedali diverranno come al Nord luogo di contagio.  Saremo in contatto con molte associazioni della regione ed il nostro supporto, il supporto di tutta una regione, sar‚àö‚Ä† mirato e diretto.  La consegna del denaro avverr‚àö‚Ä† in maniera trasparente e sar‚àö‚Ä† visibile, centesimo per centesimo, sulla nostra pagina Facebook  https://www.facebook.com/stefanolotumoloofficial/.   Ognuno di voi pu‚àö‚â§ condividere la raccolta. Pu‚àö‚â§ parteciparvi. Facciamo arrivare questo messaggio a pi‚àöœÄ persone possibili. Restiamo uniti. Andr‚àö‚Ä† tutto bene.",

            "description": "In the first month of this year, however, a sudden outbreak of the novel Coronavirus turned the entire world into a mess and put everyone on alert. This novel Coronavirus is a contagious virus originated from Wuhan, China that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, severe respiratory syndromes, and even death. It expanded rapidly after it was developed through different ways of transmission including animals to humans and humans to humans, just like how common cold is spread.  Several countries around the globe including Italy, China, United States, Japan, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, and Finland were already found to be infected with this lethal virus. According to the Chinese government officials, this novel Coronavirus first appeared in a seafood market on December 12, 2019. Within a short month, the number of people who are confirmed to be infected with this coronavirus had already become 86,657 along with 2305 deaths. the W.H.O (World Health Organization) declared the outbreak of this novel Coronavirus to be a global health emergency. Starting from February 1, 2020, travel to China , Italy , Iran, South Correa was restricted and this would lead to huge economic downfalls in every single country. Currently, tons of doctors and medical workers were fighting against the Coronavirus at the front line, and many of them had sacrificed their lives. With a tremendous amount of infected patients, China and many countries were facing medical shortages. Most of the hospitals in China desperately need supplies including masks, goggles, and protective suits. Without these types of equipment, the medical workers can be easily exposed to the Coronavirus and this can make the situation worse. So, we need your help! We appreciate everyone that is willing to participate in this fundraiser and all of the generous contributions from you will be used to purchase protective medical equipment including protective suits, N95 masks, and medical goggles. All of these were in urgent need for those medical workers in the front line. We will ensure all funds that we received will be used to purchase these types of equipment and we will update the processes. Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s all fight against the Coronavirus together",

            "description": "Hello Friends,  In light of the Corona Virus pandemic, the bay area  schools have been asked to move online .   Seventeen of my¬¨‚Ä† thirty students do not have access to computers at home . Because of this I fear that their education will suffer due to their lack of resources.  I am asking for your financial support in order to purchase the supplies needed to make sure that these students get a chance to stay up to standard during this shelter in place order.  The money donated will go to giving the kids, who do not have an accessible computer at home, a chromebook and supplies so that they will be able to join in our zoom online classes and complete their given assignments.  The chrome books cost about  $250 per unit  and I have  seventeen students  without computer access in my class. Getting them access to a chrome book is my main priority. I am also trying to supply students with headsets so that they can communicate during the online classes as well as when they video conference in groups. Lastly, any extra funds will go to books for their required bookclubs and extra supplies when needed.  These chrome books will be able to be reused in following years to make sure all student are able to complete computer assignments at home.  The financial goal of this go fund me will be  $5,000  but any donation would be a gift to us during these uncertain times.  Any help would be appreciated by classroom 16 during this time! We hope to keep learning and exploring regardless of whether in the classroom or beyond.  Ms. Richards",

UPDATE Tuesday March 17- First Donations will go out Next week!! At this moment there are a lot more applications than Donations therefore I have to pause taking new applications and try to focus more on spreading the word and get more donations to help more people. If you have any connections to any non profits or other networks that could help or are interested to team up please connect with me, For now please donate if you can or please share it with your friends!    UPDATE Sunday march 15- Applications are coming fast- However the donations are not coming as fast as the applications- Please if you have the means or know people who can help. Share this gofund me with them.    Many industries in NYC are shutting down due to the Coronavirus, causing a lot of us to loose gigs and jobs that we rely on. This unanticipated loss of income is putting a heavy stress on our financial day to day life. Many of us are unsure of how we will pay for things like rent, food, and medical bills. It's time to come together and support each other in any way possible. Now, some of us are more stable than others:¬¨‚Ä† and thats when this gofund me page comes. Give what you can, when you can‚Äö√Ñ¬∂. and if you can't at this moment it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s OK too. You can also help by sharing this fundraiser on your wall, or passing it along among friends or people who you think could potentially give at this time.    How will funds be distributed? There are hundreds and hundreds of New Yorkers who could benefit from this: we all have a friend who is a photographer, actor, artist, performer etc‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ EVERYONE is welcome to apply, however those whose income has been severely disrupted or even come to a halt as a result of COVID are especially encouraged to apply. The goal is to get funds out to most applicants within 4-5 business days. The idea is to support as many people as possible so it may not be feasible to provide the full amount of money requested. The amount provided will be dependent on the amount of donations and volume of requests which are received IF YOU NEED HELP PLEASE TAKE THIS SURVEY   https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/H5X5YWL    for full transparency all funds will be distribute by Jonah Larrama who is base in Bushwick Brooklyn NYC Instagram @jonahlarrama IMDB Jonah Larrama FB: Jonah Larrama      For other resources check:¬¨‚Ä†  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1htY4q6Aq2cg1OU7p2Q6i9x8EZy-aOxgLooUp6kgxZzw/mobilebasic?fbclid=IwAR3x2VMFVig4Eod3IkYQmOAXebmSfXVHCN9N8xWtjKdPZJgnUSoLclWyfNM        https://covid19freelanceartistresource.wordpress.com/?fbclid=IwAR1Z1VF99VwqQtuDkWzVJYBLoYGL1YjwmaHjejaFTIcuKrwJIdcWPEZ0iP8 ¬¨‚Ä†    Bartender Emergency program  https://www.usbgfoundation.org/beap?fbclid=IwAR3UCX78h7x1ybt6AIvq_RbWenvoVS2aJTqCTmGG2Jv9lKd3BHYDN2cquBY       https://www.gofundme.com/f/nyc-lowincome-artistfreelancer-relief-fund?utm_medium=copy_link utm_source=customer utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet ¬¨‚Ä†   The Hebrew Free Loan Society is given free interest loans; Things you'll need¬¨‚Ä† 1- live in NYC 5 boroughs 2-Have annual Pre tax household below 85k for one person and so on.. 3-Provide one guarantor who has credit, credit report etc Check their application here:  https://hfls.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-coronavirus-bridge-loan-application.pdf       Not NYC but wanted to share   Seattle:¬¨‚Ä† https://www.gofundme.com/f/for-artists ¬¨‚Ä†  Texas:¬¨‚Ä† https://www.ilostmygig.com/",

My mother works in healthcare as the Director of Operations for a Physician Services Group and she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s on the leadership team at their sister hospital in South Carolina; she is on the front lines of this. At this time, my mother is showing aggressive symptoms and will be hospitalized in the coming days. With my mother being sick, my father unable to work, and with me in Kansas City working with the University of Missouri Kansas City, financially we cannot do it. Due to the overwhelming nature of these events, we are asking for help to cover medical and living expenses.  I am overwhelmed and thankful by the number of people reaching out and asking how they can support. First, please pray. While we are in a turbulent time now, we have a long road ahead of us. Second, please consider giving your support as we begin this long journey of healing and rebuilding. I will continue to update you as things develop, but know that I believe we will overcome this.

Anyone who has a family or friend with special needs knows how hard it is to keep up financially with ongoing day to day therapies. Without these therapies,the future of our child is also in danger.I am asking to please donate whatever your can through our GoFundMe page.  We love the people of Albany Park and hope we will be able to continue our business here. Being a small business owner, is more than just a job,It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a daily interaction with people from all walks of life. We ask for your help at this time of uncertainty in our industry. We hope we can continue to serve you and build more friendships in the future. Thank you for the consideration.  Dimitri and staff",

            "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the particular vulnerability of our LGBTQIA+ people, especially those of color. Due to our community disproportionately experiencing a lifelong arc of violence and discrimination, many of our community members are impoverished and housing unstable.  Many folks in our community are self-employed or in the service economy, living with disabilities, chronic illnesses, and/or compromised immune systems.¬¨‚Ä†  Realizing a need for mutual aid for our communities at this time, and inspired by Ijeoma Oluo's efforts to support her community of fellow artists in Seattle  ¬¨‚Ä† Amita Swadhin organizer of CVOID-19 Relief Fund For LGBTQI+ BIPOC, Sisters PGH launched this fund on March 18th, 2020 and has since invited our trusted comrades Ciora Thomas,¬¨‚Ä† Aiden James Nevils, Aude Giglietti, Virginia Beck, Jim De‚Äö√Ñ√¥poe, Christina Acuna Castillo, to help manage the financial records and design and manage the process of fund distribution. We are all also open to other partnerships and relationships that would help this fund reach as many LGBTQIA people and organizations in Allegheny County as possible!!  We are prioritizing displaced LGBTQIA+ people because we have historically and currently faced increased barriers - including fewer ties to familial support networks, being simultaneously underserved and over-surveilled by welfare state systems, our needs have been surplus to mainstream political formations, and we tend to work in the gig economy (making us eligible to even receive unemployment.).¬¨‚Ä†  We recognize that the nation-state does not provide a safety net for so many people and that the United States government‚Äö√Ñ√¥s response to COVID-19 has only deepened pre-existing hierarchies that make specific communities more vulnerable to premature death. We hope for a world in which universal basic income, universal health care, and other functioning social systems exist. We know that what we are doing is an imperfect solution to a very large problem, but we are trying anyway.  We talked with other mutual aid funds about how they decided to distribute the money they raised and decided that we wanted to absolutely avoid parsing through people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s narratives and deciding whose needs were more important than others. We agree with Adrienne Maree Brown who quotes Lao Tzu (author of Tao Te Ching) in Emergent Strategy: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫If you do not trust the people, they will become untrustworthy.‚Äö√Ñ√π  We are choosing to trust the people. We are not social workers and we refuse to replicate that position and dynamic. Most of the pool of people who have requested funds thus far are not employed full time, have a chronic illness or disability, and were already struggling prior to COVID-19 closures. Now our community is facing an even more urgent need, and we ask our community to respond.  The application to receive funds will go LIVE March 20th, 2020 and will stay open for as long as we are able to distribute funds to our communities, meaning, we will need as much support as possible to continue supporting our LGBTQIA communities of Allegheny County.  We will continue to update here and within the campaign of our progress as we move along.  Thank you for your support!    More information about sisTers PGH: SisTers PGH is a transLED, transgender community center, that provides supportive services, shelter and housing for the trans and non binary communities of Pittsburgh, PA. SisTers PGH, also offers outreach, trans inclusion training, advocacy, and People's Pride PGH while offering opportunities for our trans communities too thrive instead of survive.   A primary function of SisTers PGH is to amplify the voices of trans people within conversations around housing access, art, city/state leadership, mental health support, medical care, employment opportunities, and education..   We have learned via lived experience, that transgender leadership amplifies our ability to serve our communities in capacities that are truly effective and influential. In the words of Tarana Burke ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Victims know what they need; give them the resources to do it.‚Äö√Ñ√π Having Trans leaders provides a voice that can garner the creation of inclusionary change within cisgender dominant spaces.   SisTers Community Center functions as a safe and brave space for our trans and nonbinary community members of Pittsburgh. Those seeking daytime respite from homelessness and/or needing supportive services like food, clothing, toiletries, tutoring/GED Prep, Name Change services, employment, medical or mental health referrals, case management, housing, and rent/utility support.   Bimonthly Groups will also be held for the trans communities with topics that vary into mental health, safety, gender, sexual health, drug addiction, leadership, race, housing and healing, just to name a few.  www.sisterspgh.org",

We are also aware some will struggle more than others and any tracks with a genuine concern (loosing a location etc - provided with evidence from the committee to back it up) will get preference in distribution - please DO NOT take the piss - this is for the sport as a whole not designed to favour anyone  I hope you see this as a proactive step for all our benefit - 100% of monies go to the clubs directly  I am doing this for the clubs, will make the discretionary decisions on distribution to the best of my ability and consequently won't take any grief in this regard - I will personally underwrite the funds¬¨‚Ä†  NWN - Brookthorpe - Slough - HNMC - Ledbury - Kent - Pendle - South Coast - Deerdale - NDOR - Ledbury  Whilst this is one way to support the clubs please - DONATE DIRECTLY TO YOUR CLUB - JOIN YOUR CLUB membership really helps as well.",

We are two nonbinary people that live in the DC area.¬¨‚Ä†  This afternoon, after a weeklong period of reduced hours, Coyne was informed that they have, along with their coworkers, been furloughed from their position at Dog Tag Bakery due to the coronavirus outbreak. The period of this furlough is indefinite, but is apparently expected to be at least six weeks, very likely more.  Given this situation, we are raising funds to meet the  equivalent of 6-8 weeks of lost wages (including tips), as that is currently the shortest period of time we expect them to experience lost income. T he application for unemployment ¬¨‚Ä†benefits process is currently murky (because they have not been officially fired, but instead have, in the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫furlough,‚Äö√Ñ√π been assigned 0 hours to their schedule indefinitely). We are in the process of soliciting legal advice and guidance on applying for unemployment benefits, but are taking this time to reach out for help during this uncertain time.¬¨‚Ä†  Coyne is also interviewing for other positions that are community-minded in the DC area, preferably with an LGBTQ+ activism and engagement component to them. :) For the moment, during the DC Department of Health advisories of self-isolation, most places are not hiring, but Coyne has one interview set up already and we are looking for more. If you have any leads please feel free to reach out to us!¬¨‚Ä†  We love you all, and thank you for your support  , if you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re not in a position to donate, for your well wishes   spreading the word.

Because so many friends and patrons have shown concern for what the much-loved 4P's employees are experiencing, I'm happy to organize this fundraising effort in support of our kitchen/dining/bar staff. Many of our employees depend entirely on tips earned from service; with that income gone, even the current gov't relief measures won't address some of their most immediate needs. I am very familiar‚Äö√Ñ√¨ having held a wait staff position for many years at 4P's before becoming a manager. Many of the 4P's staff are worried, so I'm hoping this effort can provide a little relief.  The 4P‚Äö√Ñ√¥s has always been a generous and proud supporter of so many schools, businesses, and organizations in the community! Owners Colm and Ciara are passionate about their ties to Falls Church friends, and especially to their close-knit family of employees. They are doing everything they can to reach out, lend help, and retain their staff during this shut-down. They've even generously pledged to match donations up to $10,000! Please contribute if you can: no amount is too small, and every considerate gift will be directly helping vulnerable staff through this difficult time. Please note that this is a staff-only benefit: donations will be equitably distributed directly to kitchen/dining/bar staff in need.   These workers have¬¨‚Ä†  provided great  ¬¨‚Ä†service and contributed to so many happy times over the years... Please consider helping them through this difficult time. We all look forward to seeing them back soon!  Thank you for your interest   support! -Tammy (4P's manager)",

            "description": "My wife and I live in king county Washington which as you may know is the epicenter of the coronavirus covid19 in the United States everyday is a struggle and every single day it's only seeming to get more and more difficult for us and this virus going around is a big part of the problem yet there's something else my wife and I have been dealing with since before this whole epidemic even started. 2 words kidney cancer. My wife has the absolute strongest will to live and 2 overcome extraordinarily difficult circumstances more so than anyone I've ever seen. Everyday she manages to keep going regardless of the pain she feels every second of every day. I promise you the extent of which is astronomical to such a point even when shes able to sleep she tell me there's no relief from the pain she feels. We don't have the money to hire someone to help her out with doing things so I care for her the best I possibly can because I love her more than anything and anyone else I have before yet i fear its not enough especially since being there for her all the time makes it near impossible to keep a steady job. Honestly though I'm starting to feel a bit defeated and extremely overwhelmed since the beginning of our relationship I was aware because of her epilepsy there would be challenges not every normal couple faces that's perfectly fine with me. Then when we found out about the cancer it felt like being sucker punched by Mike Tyson right in the gut. After which we've had ups and downs yet as of lately there's been far more downs. Still we try to maintain some sort of positivity for the chance of a better tomorrow. With everything happening with and around us especially after finding out where we are living is the coronavirus covid 19s epicenter of the whole United States and people with pre underlining health conditions are far more susceptible and likely to die if they get infected aka my wife they say for people who get infected that already have renal conditions the virus can make some people's kidney simply stop working and fail all together so on top of all we're facing there's also now that to worry us and fact in the back of our minds none stop.... Bottom line we need help I honestly don't know what else to attempt to do but ask for help so anybody please help us anyway you can anything helps. We would be extremely thankful for whatever kindness support anybody can help us with.",

Because of these actions, lyft and uber drivers get hit hard because there are no riders to pickup. The luxury drivers like myself even hit harder because of the stop in traveling. As you may or may not know, lyft and uber drivers are independent contractors and may not qualify for government stimulus or unemployment benefits. Many, many drivers do this job full time, which include leasing or financing used and new vehicles.¬¨‚Ä† These drivers rely on weekly pay from driving to pay for vehicle, gas, insurance, maintenance, and their own personal bills and livelihood.¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†Many of these drivers do not do it because they will get rich, but because they love to be independent, love to drive, and interact with the public. I am a driver, so I know what is happening in real-time. In the past week, Second week in March 2020) I have been on the street with my app on for 34 hrs during the week mentioned above and only got Eight (8) rides with a total of $118.24. That amount is just for gas. Not only the rides are down, but the chance of catching the virus as well.   If you ever take lyft and or uber or have an understanding how the gig economy works or so on, please make a donation.  It is hard for hail-ride drivers to just stay home and don't know where they¬¨‚Ä† are going to get their next dollar. This is real! This fund will help drivers to at least pay few important bills. This virus is a calamity that hits many sectors across the world.¬¨‚Ä†  Whatever amount you can donate, please do so. Around 80% of the State of Massachusetts shuts down for at least Three (3) weeks, with no concrete end in sight. These are crucial and trying times for everyone.  This donation will make a different to vulnerable drivers that rely on that weekly funds.  On behalf of Massachusetts lyft and uber drivers, we need your help and thank you in advance.",

This includes small businesses that are not able to provide paid leave for their employees. Compliance to this recommendation is highly encouraged, but it doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t protect the employees‚Äö√Ñ√¥ pay or provide any sort of financial relief. This leaves small business owners stuck in a very tough place.  Obsidian Nail Studio in the South Hills of Pittsburgh is owned by my sister, Stephanie Campbell. She and her three nail artists provide incredible services to their clients. Unfortunately, Obsidian Nail Studio will have to close from March 17th until March 31st, following the closure recommendation. This means that she and her nail artists won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be making any money for two entire weeks. Steph has a young daughter who will be turning nine years old during this two week closure. She and her stylists each have bills, rent, and mortgage payments. COVID-19 can close businesses, but it can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t stop the bills from coming.  I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d like to support my sister and her employees during this difficult time by raising money for them to cover their time of unemployment. All four of them together in two weeks make $12,000. Please add your support to help these beautiful ladies despite the unfortunate temporary closure of their salon and income. Thank you so much for sharing and donating!!

            "description": "I am working to help fundraise money for the families of my students who are financially affected by the COVID19 pandemic. I am a 3rd grade teacher in a Title One school in SFUSD. During this time of uncertainty and financial strain many of my students' families are struggling financially as their jobs have been suspended, schools have been cancelled, and rent and other necessities are placing strain on them. I feel it is my duty to try to assist these families in their time of need. I believe this distribution of funds will most likely look different depending on the amount of money earned in GoFundMe;¬¨‚Ä†   Tier 1 ($2000) : With your gracious donation I will assist all families with Safeway gift cards to make sure that families are able to stay healthy and well. We are working as a school to provide 13 students' families with a $150 gift card for each family. This will be based off of the highest need at the school at this time.¬¨‚Ä†   Tier 2 ($4000) : I would be able to reach out to other teachers in my community to distribute more gift cards to the greater population. We are currently compiling information about families financial and sustainable needs at this time and will be able to support families with food, household essentials, and internet access during remote school learning.   Tier 3 ($6000+) :¬¨‚Ä† With more money we will be able to reach more families within the communities! I will work with other teachers and my principal to bring financial support to families most in crisis at this moment. We are currently working on figuring out if we can get electronic devices for students who do not currently have one in their home. With your generous donation we will be able to supply some families with electronic devices so they will be able to keep up with their studies and education at home. Bringing electronic devices to students will also help to combat boredom many students face at this time of uncertainty.¬¨‚Ä†  I have already done some fundraising and have been able to give some gift cards to families and they have told me how much of a difference they have made in their lives. Most of my students live in single guardianship households who sometimes work up to three jobs to try to make ends meet. Some of my students live in transitional housing, newly provided by the state. With the imminent news of further closures and school shut downs the fear and worry have set in that there is a possibility that families will no longer be able to make rent among other things. The students at my school who participate in the free lunch program usually don't eat lunch because they don't like the selections provided by the district. Even though there is free food distributed by the district, I know that my families are not taking advantage of it because of the selections being minimal. With your help, I will work to directly support families in most need at this time. While in this time of need, gathering around the table for a home cooked meal and spending time with family without the worry of where your next meal will come from will make all the difference. Please consider helping the community and giving directly to families in most need at this time. Thank you for reading!",

            "description": "When we first opened  Aloha Nails  in 2018 @ Rea Farms, we were super excited at the opportunity to serve our beloved Mecklenburg county. As a start of any business, it was a struggle at first but with hard work, perseverance   passion, our business began to blossom and our Aloha Family grew. Everyday that we woke up to open  Aloha Nails Rea Farms , we were overflowed with gratitude, especially with the constant support of our beloved clients. For our dream is finally happening: a wonderful work place filled with dedicated staff and wonderful clients.  This dream came to a halt the past couple of weeks when COVID-19 began to make its sinister way into the US, then NC, then our beloved Mecklenburg county. We saw the increasing fear and anxiety in our staff‚Äö√Ñ√¥s faces as people began to social distant and we could almost hear their thoughts: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Am I going to be lay-off?‚Äö√Ñ√π and ‚Äö√Ñ√∫How am I going to pay my bills!‚Äö√Ñ√π Then it happened. Local, state   federal guideline of  ‚Äö√Ñ√∫social distancing‚Äö√Ñ√π  was officially issued to flatten the curve. With a heavy heart, we made a painful decision to  temporarily close  on Wednesday the 18th - March 31st (or even possibly longer!) to do our part for the sake of our staff and client's health. We pray that if everyone social distant NOW, we can all go back to our normal life SOON. As any business owner out there right now, we are terrified with income loss while still having countless overhead fees and rent to pay. However, even more devastating is our dear staff who are now without jobs and thus without income (esp tips) to support their family.  And so here is our plea: Please donate however much you can to help our Aloha staff.  100% of donation will go to them, after campaign fees.  For us, to see that they have clients and friends out there who care enough to donate   help them out during this crisis, is already a reward in itself.¬¨‚Ä† We can't wait for life to be back to normal again and to again serve our beloved Mecklenburg county.    Thank you  for your support always   Aloha!  much love,   Lesley   Codie  Instagram/facebook @ alohanailsreafarms www.alohanailsreafarms.com",

            "description": "Hallo da drau‚àö√ºen,  Mein Name ist Simone. ich bin erfolgreiche Studentin der Religionswissenschaft und stehe kurz vor meinem Abschluss. Ich habe zwei wundersch‚àö‚àÇne Katzen, von denen eine 10 und eine 6 Jahre alt ist und von denen ich mich niemals trennen k‚àö‚àÇnnte. Eher w‚àö¬∫rde ich auf mein Essen verzichten als dass es ihnen an etwas fehlen sollte. Ich bin Afghanistan-Veteranin und habe bis gestern mein Leben mehr oder weniger aus eigener Kraft bestreiten k‚àö‚àÇnnen, seit ich 17 Jahre alt bin.    Heute habe ich meine K‚àö¬∫ndigung erhalten. In unserer Firma wurden ‚àö¬∫ber 100 Mitarbeiter, die sich noch in der Probezeit befanden, spontan entlassen, obwohl man uns noch letzte Woche beschwichtigt hat, dass niemand sich Sorgen machen muss. Nun bin ich ab April arbeitslos.     Das Problem ist: ich bin im letzten Mastersemester und kann nur Arbeitslosengeld beantragen, wenn ich mich exmatrikuliere; kurz vor meiner Abschlusspr‚àö¬∫fung. Mein Lebenstraum, der Masterabschluss, w‚àö¬ßre dann beendet.  Ich bin Arbeiterkind, war 14 Jahre bei der Bundeswehr und habe immer hart darum gek‚àö¬ßmpft endlich studieren zu d‚àö¬∫rfen, und bis vor Kurzem habe ich es aus eigenen Mitteln bestreiten k‚àö‚àÇnnen, manchmal auch mit etwas Hilfe von Freunden. Dann wurde ich durch meinen vorherigen Job krank durch Mobbing, habe im Oktober nach langer Krankheit endlich die Kraft gehabt zu wechseln, und wurde jetzt zusammen mit allen meinen Kollegen, die wie ich noch in der Probezeit waren gefeuert. Es waren nur noch zwei Wochen Probezeit... aber das war egal. Laut meiner Teamleiterin werden wir wegen einer Corona-bedingten Flaute entlassen. Jetzt habe ich also nicht nur kein Gehalt, sondern auch bald keine Krankenversicherung mehr, da ich mich f‚àö¬∫r 190 Euro im Monat aus eigener Tasche freiwillig versichern m‚àö¬∫sste. Als w‚àö¬ßre das nicht schon anstrengend genug, bin ich gerade in einer tagesklinischen Behandlung, oder w‚àö¬ßre es, aber auch meine Klinik (LWL Bochum) wurde zwangsevakuiert wegen einer einzigen Corona-Infektion in einem anderen Geb‚àö¬ßude.    Ich bin jetzt 43 Jahre alt und habe erst durch meine bewegte Lebensgeschichte mit 38 anfangen k‚àö‚àÇnnen zu studieren. In meinem Alter bin ich nicht BAF‚àö√±G-berechtigt. Dass ich mein Studium bisher in einem angemessenen Zeitrahmen durchgezogen habe, ist dabei leider unwichtig. Ich sollte jetzt vom 3. ins 4. Mastersemester wechseln und dann meinen Abschluss machen. Ich habe zwar einen Studienkredit (auch die sind in meinem Alter sehr schwer zu finden), aber der deckt gerade so einmal die Kaltmiete ab. Aufgrund meiner derzeitigen Erkrankung ist auch eine Wiederaufnahme in die Tagesklinik geplant, also w‚àö¬ßre eine Bewerbung zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt unsinnig, ich m‚àö¬∫sste ja vermutlich in den n‚àö¬ßchsten Wochen eh wieder zur‚àö¬∫ck ins Krankenhaus. Aber ob ich bis dahin noch versichert bin, ist fraglich. Oder ich muss meinen Lebenstraum auf der Zielgeraden begraben.    Die Lage ist ziemlich schlimm, ich bekomme in zwei Wochen mein letztes Gehalt und dann stehe ich buchst‚àö¬ßblich vor dem Nichts, da f‚àö¬∫r jemanden in meiner Lebenssituation einfach niemand zust‚àö¬ßndig ist, kein Amt, keine Beh‚àö‚àÇrde, kein Notfallplan. Alles, was ich brauche, ist etwas Hilfe, um die n‚àö¬ßchsten zwei Monate zu ‚àö¬∫berstehen.  Kann mir jemand da drau‚àö√ºen helfen?",

            "description": "The COVID-19 Crisis is affecting the entire world right now, which means that there are multiple communities from all over the world who are at risk of different problems. Here at the University of Oklahoma, international students are a particularly vulnerable community.   Many students rely on employment and its income for their needs, paying their tuition or affording healthcare. Those students currently have reduced work hours and cannot afford basic necessities, and in many cases, may have to spend more money for unanticipated summer housing or travel costs.  There are 2,155 international students at OU from 135 different countries, all with different border restrictions caused by COVID-19. Based on initial survey data, we have found that multiple students are in dire need of money for everything from medication to housing to groceries.  Thus, we are starting with a 5,000 USD goal. It might seem like a lot, but a lot of students are facing immediate situations and troubles with wide ranges.¬¨‚Ä†  We urgently ask for your help. This campaign will remain open to receive donations, so please continue donating and sharing to the best of your ability! Everything will go to help international students!    The International Advisory Committee (IAC) is an international student organization (ISO) that serves as the umbrella for all other ISOs. We are student run and are advised by the College of International Studies. We advocate for international students on campus and the international community as a whole. We also bring different events to OU, including International Bazaar, International Prom, Human Library, International Pageant and the sadly cancelled Eve of Nations due to COVID-19 fears .",

I'm asking for assistance for them to help pay their storage fees and flights back home and or stay in the US. As some of the foreign students with no place to go.  This is the last semester and finals are here they shouldn't be worrying about this. With 5k we can help out at least 10 students.¬¨‚Ä†  Thank you for helping these kids.

Team Darex is an app where people get challenged to help homeles person and can win money.  For example, if you put in 5 dollars to help a homeless person in a fun way, and 600 people accept, you will help 600 people to water or food. They also need to record this, so you know exactly which person you helped.  In order to grow, we need challenges. So we can reach a lot of people.¬¨‚Ä†  THE IMPACT YOU CAN HAVE WITH SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT IS UNBELIEVABLE!  For each 5 $ or euro we will add a challenge in the app to help a homeless person to water and food. The more money the more challenges.  All donors get a link with the app so they can see how many people got the help they need.  Please think of the other people als help them.¬¨‚Ä†  The team you see in the picture are the Indian people who developed the application in their free time in order to bring good to the world.",

Since then, the numbers of those infected and died have grown exponentially, killing over 600 people with another 30,000 infected. The effects of the novel coronavirus are very evident throughout China seen with roads being blocked, major cities being quarantined, and hospitals being inundated with thousands of cases. This surplus of patients has led to an extreme shortage of supplies that are necessary for the doctors to treat the sick, including face masks, medical goggles, and hazmat suits. As this virus is relatively new, not much is known about it yet making it unpredictable and threatening.  This is why we need your help. There are over 98 million people living in the epicenter of this outbreak with no way out, making it an extremely dangerous situation for them. Even a donation of $5 is sufficient to provide aid to those on the frontlines battling the coronavirus. I have partnered with the ACP Foundation and the North Texas Hubei Association who will be able to ensure supplies can be shipped to the Hubei province as soon as possible. All proceeds will be donated towards North Texas Hubei Association who has sellers to purchase the supplies from (face masks, gloves, sanitation suits, etc.) to distribute to various hospitals in the Hubei province. This association has already delivered 10,000 medical gowns, 35,000 face masks, and 1,875 protective goggles to Hubei Province. The situation in China is worsening and they need all the aid they can receive. Please support us as we join ranks with the citizens of Wuhan and fight against the Novel Coronavirus.

We look forward to coming back online and seeing everyone together again soon!    From all of us at Flip Flip,¬¨‚Ä† THANK YOU!",

            "description": "Please join our movement to protect those that are at risk safe from CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19).    The Public Health England briefing states: As many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9m people) may require hospitalisation and the NHS currently cannot support these numbers which sadly means that those who are the most vulnerable will be killed by the virus.  People over 60, and especially over 80, are particularly vulnerable to severe or fatal infection. As of right now, time is crucial in making sure that those who fall within these categories are kept safe.  Our main focus will be to get a team together as soon as possible to protect the elderly by reducing the rate at which the Coronavirus spreads to them, your donation will be spent on:   1. Touring the country to provide them with emergency hygiene parcels at these times of shortage containing SOAP, SHAMPOO, BODY WASH, TOILET PAPER, HAND SANITISER and HAND WASH.    2. Providing them with food packages that contain none perishable foods such as CANNED GOODS, PASTA, RICE.SUGAR, TEA AND CEREALS to name a few.    3. Have someone speak to them regularly at times of isolation to make sure that they don't feel lonely and that their mental health is also being looked after.¬¨‚Ä†   With your support, we can make this journey as easy as possible for them and help save the lives of thousands of people so in future when we look back we can truly say to ourselves that we did something for those that felt helpless.

Right now, over 5,000 people in Berkeley and Oakland are experiencing homelessness.¬¨‚Ä†  People who live in tent encampments are at higher-risk of getting the virus because they live in close quarters and lack hygiene resources. Also, the disease is more likely to be life-threatening for them due to poor nutrition, chronic health conditions, and lack of access to health care.  Volunteers at the  Berkeley Free Clinic  have been visiting encampments to distribute supplies, and we noticed that residents at some encampments have  no way to wash their hands . The cities of Berkeley and Oakland have installed hand washing stations at various encampments, but we've discovered that there are at least 10 encampments that they have overlooked. We are trying to raise money to buy  2 hand washing stations (~$90 each with tax) for each of those 10 encampments , as well as hand soap and hand sanitizer dispensers. Any extra funds will go towards buying¬¨‚Ä†hand sanitizer bottles, water bottles, food,¬¨‚Ä†Tylenol, cold medicine, socks, masks, gloves, tents, informational fliers, porta-potties, harm reduction supplies,¬¨‚Ä†transportation¬¨‚Ä†to care, and other things that encampment residents request.   Our healthcare system and local governments are nearly stretched to the limit due to this epidemic, so it is up to each one of us to make sure our neighbors have the resources they need to protect themselves. In times like these, it is more important than ever to practice radical compassion and love.¬¨‚Ä†  Please support our efforts by donating. Anything helps!¬¨‚Ä†",

Let me tell you more about her:  Christell joined the FDNY as an EMT in January of 2012, nearly 2 years later she became a Paramedic and is currently stationed at Sta 47.  Christell is charasmatic, resilient, funny, and incredibly kind.     She understands the need for EMS during these difficult and trying times. She knows what being on the front lines of the fight against Covid-19 entails. She has always loved being the 1st line of defense and care in emergency medicine.   She wants all First Responders to know: \"\"Take care of yourselves first. Make sure you go home whole at the end of the day.\"\"¬¨‚Ä†  She wants the world to know: \"\"Everyone is fighting the virus differently. Many thousands are recovering from it but its still a serious issue to be taken with precaution around others.\"\"  Christell joined EMS out of love. Love for her community and strangers alike; making a difference in patients lives and helping all those she has come into contact with while working as an EMT and now as a Paramedic.¬¨‚Ä†  Please, let's band together, as a community, near and far, young and old,EMS and civilians and help Christell during her battle against Covid-19 and her continued battle when she is released, as her fight won't stop there.

Niet omdat we geen solide bedrijf zijn, wel omdat het gat wat nu valt te groot is om 'even' op te vangen.¬¨‚Ä†  We roepen jullie hulp in voor de continuiteit van Sense Restaurant, help onze dit gat op te vangen; salarissen en leveranciers zullen met jullie hulp betaald kunnen worden en dat is essentieel om deze klap op te kunnen vangen.¬¨‚Ä†  Wat krijgen jullie terug voor jullie steun? Naast intense dankbaarheid een tegoedbon t.w.v. hetzelfde bedrag wat ge‚àö√ònvesteerd is ‚àö¬©n een glas champagne wanneer we samen vieren dat we er nog zijn. En zullen blijven. De eerste van de maand april zullen we starten met het uitgeven van de cadeaubonnen en nemen we contact met je op!   Wil je een gift geven? Doneer dan anoniem :-)  In tijden van nood hebben we elkaar nodig, laten we er zijn voor elkaar. Voor nu, blijf veilig en zorg goed voor je naasten!  Dank, ¬¨‚Ä†inmense dank en hopelijk tot snel.  Warme groet,  Dennis Middeldorp   team Sense   www.senserestaurant.nl",

            "description": "Hey, hon, welcome in!\"\"  It's words that I've said on a daily basis since I finally completed my dream of opening Court of Gamers, running my own business. I tell the story all the time, how the really beat up open close sign hanging in our front window has been under my bed since I was four years old and boldly claimed to my parents that I was only ever going to work for myself. Not exactly how it worked out, but close enough for me to still happily flip that sign every single day.  Court of Gamers is a family. I can't tell you how many times I've heard the words \"\"Coming here is like coming to a friends house.\"\" it's what I strive for every day. We're a place to escape the world that is stressful and hard. The idea of losing CoG (As she's affectionately known) terrifies me to my core.  The last few days have been filled with tears as I have stressed over my small business. But I know I'm not alone in this. COVID-19 is threatening small businesses, non-profits, and so many more. Which is why we're running our GoFundMe a little bit differently than others.  We know you can only donate so much, and money can only go so far. That's why Court of Gamers, is going to help others. A portion of your donations will go to help other small businesses, most specifically a small Chinese restaurant. If you've been to CoG, you've probably been to the wonderful Tang St. They're a second family to us, and neither of us want to continue without the other.  Secondly we're going to be giving a portion to Thrive Youth Center. Thrive is an amazing wonderful place. I've been so fortunate I've never needed their help, but so many LGBTQ kids do. With colleges closing people are forced to go home right now, and sometimes home isn't the best place, or even worse, not an option.  Court of Gamers has never been about me, my store, my life. It's always been about you, even if you reading this has never been into CoG. It doesn't really matter. CoG has always been there for you, a safe haven, an inclusive haven. With your help and with the help of #SmallBusinessRelief, we're not going anywhere. We're going to help our neighbors in these trying times. We will see the other side of COVID-19  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and thank you even more if you hit that donate button. May the days ahead be better than those behind us.

            "description": "WowCater,  www.wowcater.com , was one of the first and hardest hit businesses in California by the Coronavirus. We are the newest office catering service and don't have investors, making us highly vulnerable to the economic hardship of this outbreak.  Over the last week, starting 3/9/20, our business lost 100% of its business in one week. We have over a dozen employees and need this money for payroll and to pay other bills.  Your funds will help us pay our employees so they can afford things like rent and groceries etc. Further details of this is at the very bottom.  Any extra money will be used to help expand the business.¬¨‚Ä†  Your funds will also be immediately used to keep WowCater in business. This helps an entire community of people through all the other small businesses that WowCater impacts (local restaurants and catering kitchens) These small businesses depend on us to help support and grow their businesses. If WowCater goes out of business it could start a chain reaction with other local businesses.  We are a small local business in the San Francisco Bay Area. The business was built debt free and free of other financial help. We wanted to keep it that way but the situation with COVID-19 has completely and utterly destroyed our business. Our net revenue is now $0. WowCater connects offices with local restaurants and kitchens and provides the delivery of these meals as well. WowCater does not cook any food, so there is no other source of income for us.  WowCater provides local offices with daily/weekly catered lunches or other meals. With the outbreak, all our customers have decided to work from home. We are destitute and are is desperate need of help.  The good news is that this situation is temporary and when everything blows over, our customers have committed to resume business with us. We just need help to survive until then.   Over the next few years WowCater will expand into several other cities. We are the newest office catering service. Unlike most of our competitors we deliver the food ourselves. This ensures the delivery is timely and our customers receive GPS tracking. We have the most high tech platform that is highly automated and our software can order food based on each office's unique preferences. Customers have an online dashboard to view their menus and request changes. We have Slack integrations to allow a message to be sent to all employees that says \"\"Lunch is ready\"\" as soon as our catering specialist clicks \"\"complete\"\" on the app. We check that setups are done correctly through the photos that our employees are required to upload in the app as well. We've sourced the best kitchens and offer only the best food.¬¨‚Ä†  All of us at WowCater are so very grateful for your help! It means the world to us! We have no other options and your help ensures that our company can survive this and provide our much needed service for many years to come.  From all of us at WowCater, THANK YOU!  EMPLOYEE PAY: If we only reach less than 50% of our goal, that percentage will be the same that we pay employees. For instance, if 30% of the goal is reached, we will pay our employees 30% of their normal wages. (Normal wages will be calculated as the average pay they received, calculated since the beginning of the year to March 1st.) If we reach 20% of the goal employees will receive 20% their average pay etc.   Here's where it gets interesting, once we pass 50% of our goal, the amount we pay our employees goes up 20%. For instance, if we reach 51% of our goal, we will pay our employees 71% of average pay! 65% of the goal, we pay 85% average payroll. This will continue until it reaches 100%",

            "description": "Help keep a vital part of the community alive! Flamingos Coffee House needs your help.   Opening its doors to the local LGBTQ+ community and beyond in 2018, Flamingos Coffee House has been a vital part of the Leeds scene since, providing a safe space for local LGBTQ+ groups, raising money for charity and being a much needed dry space to spend time with friends and family in a welcoming environment.   We as a country are facing an unprecedented challenge in Covid-19 and we all have a responsibility to help keep those vulnerable to the virus safe. For James and the staff at Flamingos this means extra time spent deep cleaning and disinfecting, but for many customers it sadly means staying at home isolated from the illness. This means that Flamingos is in danger; takings have already dropped and are only set to drop further as more and more people are forced to self-isolate, work from home or even spend time in hospital.   Nobody wants to loose Flamingos as the meeting space, socialising space and stuffing-face-with-cake space so we want to raise money to cover the lost money so James can continue paying rent, bills, suppliers and, most importantly, his staff (who are on proper contracts - not nasty zero hours contracts) - themselves valued members of our community.   ¬¨¬£10000 would not cover everything but would go a long way to allowing Flamingos survive this crisis and come out the other side live, kicking and ready to give back to the community as only they are capable of.   We will be regularly posting stories and quotes from its many customers and devotees expressing just how much this space means to them.",

            "description": "All‚Äö√Ñ√¥uomo, sin dall‚Äö√Ñ√¥alba dei tempi, spetta un compito importante: l‚Äö√Ñ√¥adattamento. L‚Äö√Ñ√¥essere umano ha conosciuto numerose evoluzioni, nel corso dei secoli. ‚àö√† stato ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Abilis‚Äö√Ñ√π, ‚àö¬Æ stato ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Erectus‚Äö√Ñ√π, ‚àö¬Æ stato ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Sapiens‚Äö√Ñ√π, ‚àö¬Æ stato ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Sapiens Sapiens‚Äö√Ñ√π.   Ci‚àö‚â§ che l‚Äö√Ñ√¥uomo dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥era moderna ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a tratti ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ ignora, ‚àö¬Æ che la sua evoluzione non ‚àö¬Æ terminata: all‚Äö√Ñ√¥uomo, per sempre, sar‚àö‚Ä† chiesto di adattarsi e ri-adattarsi all‚Äö√Ñ√¥ambiente circostante, alla societ‚àö‚Ä† civile, economica e politica che impone trasformazioni individuali e collettive.   L‚Äö√Ñ√¥uomo, per‚àö‚â§, come tutti gli altri animali, ‚àö¬Æ un essere istintivo: istintivamente reagisce ai cambiamenti e alle trasformazioni con la ‚Äö√Ñ√∫paura‚Äö√Ñ√π. La paura ‚àö¬Æ uno dei sentimenti pi‚àöœÄ immediati della natura umana e anche quello che pi‚àöœÄ rischia di assoggettarci all‚Äö√Ñ√¥immobilismo.  Funzionalmente l‚Äö√Ñ√¥uomo ‚àö¬Æ chiamato a rispondere: i periodi di grande mutamento, le crisi sociali o psicologiche richiedono una grande predisposizione al coraggio; non possiamo perdere la sfida dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥evoluzione; non possiamo rassegnarci alla passivit‚àö‚Ä†.  Nei periodi bui dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥umanit‚àö‚Ä†, quelli che oggi conosciamo attraverso le pagine dei libri di storia, l‚Äö√Ñ√¥evoluzione non si ‚àö¬Æ fermata; il progresso, che aveva lo stesso nome anche nel Medioevo (per antonomasia il periodo pi‚àöœÄ buio nella storia dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥uomo), non si ‚àö¬Æ mai arrestato. Tutte le epoche storiche hanno conosciuto grandi menti: poeti, artisti, filosofi, tutti rispondevano a un solo richiamo; la voglia di andare avanti.  Andare avanti, spesso, sembra impossibile; andareavanti, a volte, pu‚àö‚â§ sembrare un controsenso, una contro-evoluzione. Andare avanti, per‚àö‚â§, ‚àö¬Æ l‚Äö√Ñ√¥unico sforzo a cui siamo chiamati: la mente dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥uomo non ‚àö¬Æ predisposta ai vincoli e alle limitazioni; ‚àö¬Æ per questo motivo, dunque, che bisogna attivarsi concretamente per poter abbattere tutte le barriere, formali e intuitive, che, spesso, altri uomini ci frappongono sul cammino.  Quello che sta vivendo l‚Äö√Ñ√¥Italia, nell‚Äö√Ñ√¥ultimo periodo, sembra un po‚Äö√Ñ√¥ la trasposizione moderna del Medioevo: la gente ha timore di poter morire dall‚Äö√Ñ√¥oggi al domani, ha paura di poter contagiare un altro anche solo tendendogli la mano, ha paura di precipitare nell‚Äö√Ñ√¥oscurantismo e si aggrappa a quello che percepisce come unico mezzo per la salvaguardia del bene comune: Dio.  Noi, per‚àö‚â§, non siamo nel Medioevo e, soprattutto, da cittadini evoluti e abitanti del mondo sappiamo che, persino quell‚Äö√Ñ√¥epoca, ci ha lasciato qualcosa da cui poter ripartire.  Il ventunesimo secolo ‚àö¬Æ il secolo delle sfide e della velocit‚àö‚Ä†: solo chi ha fame pu‚àö‚â§ sopravvivere, solo chi riesce ad adattarsi, in moto perpetuo, pu‚àö‚â§ aspirare alla luce del sole.  Chi ha fame, per‚àö‚â§, pu‚àö‚â§ provare comunque e istintivamente paura: ‚àö¬Æ per questo che, nei momenti di disperazione, bisogna cercare un cammino comune; qualcosa che, ancora di pi‚àöœÄ, ci faccia percepire l‚Äö√Ñ√¥appartenenza a un unico grande genere: l‚Äö√Ñ√¥umanit‚àö‚Ä†.  ‚àö√† per questo motivo che sono qui per presentarti un progetto; un progetto che non sia esclusivo alle capacit‚àö‚Ä† di poche persone ma che possa accorpare quanti pi‚àöœÄ protagonisti dello stesso palcoscenico.   Mi rivolgo a tutti gli imprenditori delle piccole e medie imprese e anche a quelli delle micro imprese.   La crisi ‚àö¬Æ un effetto domino: prima c‚Äö√Ñ√¥‚àö¬Æ lei da sola, poi c‚Äö√Ñ√¥‚àö¬Æ la crisi della crisi e, alla fine, c‚Äö√Ñ√¥‚àö¬Æ la nevrosi. In un momento di nevrosi collettiva, dunque, lascia che ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ nel mio piccolo ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ possa parlarti di qualcosa che ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ spero ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ possa fare la differenza e possa portare l‚Äö√Ñ√¥ago della bussola a tendere verso un nuovo orizzonte.   Quello che voglio costituire ‚àö¬Æ un fondo ‚Äö√Ñ√∫paracadute‚Äö√Ñ√πper le micro-imprese: lo scopo ‚àö¬Æ dare vita a una raccolta fondi intestato a una ONLUS che lavorer‚àö‚Ä† per salvaguardare le piccole e micro imprese italiane. Nell‚Äö√Ñ√¥80% dei casi le aziende sono abbandonate a se stesse: vanno in insofferenza bancaria, non riescono a ottemperare gli assegni bancari. Mi riferisco anche a piccole cifre: anche solo 400 ‚Äö√á¬® possono determinare il futuro di un‚Äö√Ñ√¥azienda; molto spesso tutto ci‚àö‚â§ corrisponde anche a sbagliate tempistiche: prima delle festivit‚àö‚Ä† un‚Äö√Ñ√¥azienda potrebbe andare in sofferenza; ancora, in un periodo particolarmente critico un‚Äö√Ñ√¥azienda potrebbe conoscere deficit.   Lo scopo di questo fondo, dunque, sarebbe aiutare le aziende: essendo un fondo di aiuto per extremis, non pu‚àö‚â§ essere utilizzato pi‚àöœÄ di una sola volta per ogni azienda, bens‚àö¬® saranno pi‚àöœÄ aziende a poterne beneficiare nell‚Äö√Ñ√¥arco di vita stessa della ONLUS.   Questo ‚àö¬Æ un fondo ‚Äö√Ñ√∫perduto‚Äö√Ñ√π: le aziende che ne beneficeranno non dovranno restituire nulla, nessun centesimo; se non ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ solo di fronte a casi benevoli ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ potr‚àö‚Ä† restituire i soldi A TASSO ZERO, semplicemente per aiutare un‚Äö√Ñ√¥altra impresa. Lo scopo, dunque, ‚àö¬Æ creare un fondo rotativo, un circolo virtuoso: non ‚àö¬Æ un finanziamento ma un prestito a tasso zero che comporta zero spese. Nel momento in cui l‚Äö√Ñ√¥azienda sar‚àö‚Ä† in piena capacit‚àö‚Ä† di poter restituire i soldi presi, l‚Äö√Ñ√¥ONLUS sar‚àö‚Ä† ben disposta ad accettare l‚Äö√Ñ√¥accredito; in caso contrario, se l‚Äö√Ñ√¥azienda non avesse ancora recuperato la sua indipendenza economica, non le sar‚àö‚Ä† chiesto di restituire ci‚àö‚â§ di cui ha beneficiato.  Le aziende potranno richiedere questa sorta di finanziamento solo ed esclusivamente attraverso l‚Äö√Ñ√¥invio dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥estratto conto bancario e dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥assegno che sta per essere protestato: solo quando ci sar‚àö‚Ä† la chiara visione dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥assegno che sta per andare in protesta e solo quando ci sar‚àö‚Ä† la visione dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥estratto conto bancario a riprovadella situazione bancaria di deficit, solo in questo caso si potranno versare questi finanziamenti per la salvaguardia e la tutela economica dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥azienda richiedente.   Per di pi‚àöœÄ: con i finanziamenti di questo fondo potranno essere pagati dei professionisti che aiuteranno le aziende a evitare proprio questi problemi; si offriranno, dunque, consulenze aziendali che toccano anche il tema della digitalizzazione, ormai all‚Äö√Ñ√¥ordine del giorno nella costruzione dell‚Äö√Ñ√¥assetto aziendale. Tutto ci‚àö‚â§ ‚àö¬Æ a costo zero: ci sar‚àö‚Ä† un team di esperti ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ pagati internamente alla ONLUS ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ che avr‚àö‚Ä† il solo compito di aiutare le aziende a titolo pro bono.   Questa, ‚àö¬Æ bene che si sappia, ‚àö¬Æ un‚Äö√Ñ√¥idea estremamenteembrionale, ‚àö¬Æ solo una bozza di pensiero che ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ mi auguro ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ possa essere accolta da tutti gli imprenditori che si ritrovano spesso (tacitamente) a vivere la stessa condizione di abbandono e arresa: questo ‚àö¬Æ un modo per aiutare le aziende, non vi ‚àö¬Æ alcun scopo di lucro e va oltre qualsiasi preconcetto: tra queste righe non vi ‚àö¬Æ alcun assetto politico, perch‚àö¬© la politica non pu‚àö‚â§ entrare nella nostra storia.  Questo ‚àö¬Æ un aiuto DAGLI IMPRENDITORI, PER GLI IMPRENDITORI.",

Despite this, her life was unexpectedly taken away while she vacationed in Mexico. She never got to wake up to kiss her daughter, Viviana in the morning or to comfort her oldest son Adrian, who was waiting for her return.  Words just simply cannot express how much pain this immense loss has inflicted on our entire family, especially for her children. We are asking for your prayers during this difficult time including any support to cover her funeral costs and expenses. Any amount will be genuinely appreciated as it would greatly help to lessen the financial burden and give her the proper honor and memorial that my sister deserves.  Please feel free to share this to let others know. God bless. Isaiah 33:2 Lord, be gracious to us, we long for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of distress. //  El 3 de enero del 2017, mi hermana Fabiola Rodr‚àö‚â†guez, nunca regres‚àö‚â• a casa.

            "description": "WITH YOUR HELP, ETERNA CAN DEVELOP A SAFE mRNA VACCINE AGAINST COVID-19 IN TIME TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.   With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the  Eterna  project is looking to harness online gamers toward a solution. Their mission? To develop a safe mRNA vaccine as well as future challenges to create new antivirals and improved diagnostics. As part of this effort, the team is raising funds to bring on a software developer and an instructional designer (and/or game designer) to expand the capabilities of Eterna.   Fighting COVID-19 with a Safe mRNA Vaccine  Over the next few weeks, Eterna is attempting to develop an RNA vaccine with:¬¨‚Ä†  (1) improved in-patient production so that smaller amounts of RNA can be used, which decreases the risk of an adverse immune response  (2) increased stability in syringes so that a vaccine can be stored and distributed ready-to-go, and  (3) the ability to be turned off with a pill or a cream, to stop an adverse immune response among the small percentage of people who will get such a response.  For an RNA vaccine to be safe, it must have all three of these properties. Eterna will design RNA puzzles that attempt to satisfy these criteria, and winning designs will be experimentally tested by scientists. Because the biology of COVID-19 and vaccines is complex, our first priority is to get the Eterna community ready to design the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫real‚Äö√Ñ√π medicines. We need as many online gamers as possible who are skilled enough to identify RNA designs with the potential to be a vaccine.   JOIN US IN STOPPING COVID-19 BY ENABLING ONLINE GAMERS AROUND THE WORLD TO BECOME HIGHLY SKILLED AT ETERNA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  Your contribution will achieve these goals:  GOAL #1:  Make Eterna playable on mobile phones so that gamers worldwide can participate, increasing the size of Eterna‚Äö√Ñ√¥s playerbase able to tackle the COVID-19 challenge.   GOAL #2:  Create training materials that bring new players of Eterna up to speed fast.  This will include puzzles with preparation specific to COVID-19.  GOAL #3:  Develop digital curricula for secondary and postsecondary students who must for the foreseeable future stay at home for their education.  This learning material will be shared with online educational services such as Khan Academy, so that globally students can engage in the fight against COVID-19 and ‚Äö√Ñ√∫know the enemy.‚Äö√Ñ√π   About Eterna  Eterna is a citizen science videogame and research platform where players solve puzzles using RNA‚Äö√Ñ√¥s four bases to design RNAs with specific properties, including stability, transformation, and calculation. Eterna has been featured in publications such as  Wired , the  New York Times , the  Wall Street Journal ,  CNN , and  NOVA . The project has tackled challenges such as the development of a  fast, low-cost tuberculosis diagnostic  (the disease being one of the world‚Äö√Ñ√¥s largest public health crises),  improving the safety of CRISPR gene editing ¬¨‚Ä†, and  enabling ribosome engineering to develop novel materials .  Through the abstraction of a puzzle/logic game, individuals with no scientific background are able to make meaningful contributions to areas such as fundamental biochemistry, diagnostics, therapeutics, material design, and more. To date, more than 100,000 players have joined and played.  RNA is an extremely powerful molecule at the heart of many cellular processes, carrying out its functions by folding into complex shapes. RNA research has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in diagnosing and treating the most prevalent and dangerous diseases and even the development of technologies outside of medicine that are impossible through conventional means. However, scientists don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t fully understand the behavior of RNA. Creating synthetic designs to carry out a specific function and predicting how well they will perform when created are extremely difficult - but the diverse community of Eterna players, representing a wide variety of ages, locations, and backgrounds, are able to tackle this challenge head on, and have done so with great success.  Eterna players explore the broad solution space of RNA design by collectively using knowledge of science together with human observation and intuition. The Eterna player community consistently performs better than software packages. Eterna has published  multiple papers  on their findings. Principle Investigator Rhiju Das wrote  this review  about how citizen science games are changing research.   THANK YOU FOR HELPING ETERNA FIGHT COVID-19!   In the future, you can donate to Eterna  here .     More About the Campaign   GOAL #1.  Implementing Mobile Playability : Allowing Eterna to be playable on mobile devices will greatly increase its reach, including to potential players in areas most affected by the pandemic in Europe and Asia. We will have a software developer update Eterna‚Äö√Ñ√¥s user interface to allow for streamlined usage on smaller screens and touchscreens.  GOAL #2.  Improving Player Onboarding : We will employ an instructional designer and/or game designer to redesign tutorials that allow new players to learn Eterna more rapidly and gain better skill sets, as well as create new tutorials and other training specific to the upcoming COVID-19 challenge. There is a significant opportunity to develop tutorials that lower the learning curve, maximize engagement, and ultimately lead to more and more knowledgeable players contributing to Eterna. We may also want a software developer to revise the current website and game code to allow us to carry out new teaching strategies.  GOAL #3.  Developing Educational Curricula : With the closure of schools due to COVID-19, there is significant interest in digital learning curricula. Eterna previously partnered with NOVA Labs through WGBH Boston to create educational content that introduces RNA and its biological role. We are already developing puzzles and materials specific to COVID-19, so we would like to develop new modules in a similar format. This will require further assistance from an instructional designer to create targeted materials (specifically for a secondary and postsecondary audience), as well as a software developer to either update the existing NOVA Labs infrastructure (which is partially built on Flash, is soon to be unavailable, and may or may not be easily extended for new modules) or create a novel platform for producing educational lessons with Eterna.  Any remaining funds will be used to support ongoing software development and research projects that further Eterna‚Äö√Ñ√¥s mission to empower citizen scientists to contribute to breakthroughs in medicine and biotechnology.",

With over 800 fatalities,¬¨‚Ä†Italy‚Äö√Ñ√¥s death toll¬¨‚Ä†is significantly higher than the next three hardest-hit nations combined.  Now AS Roma and our foundation, Roma Cares, want to help raise much-needed funds to help Lazzaro Spallanzani Hospital in Rome deal with the crisis. The hospital is at the epicenter of the battle in Italy to save the lives of those infected by the disease all over the country.   Amongst the first cases treated by the hospital were the two Chinese tourists who contracted the virus in their homeland, and who are now recovering.  Given the national emergency, the money we are hoping to raise with the help of you, the public, will be used by the hospital to purchase clinical diagnostic equipment to improve infected patient care and essential supplies to facilitate the work of the doctors and nurses treating the virus.

            "description": "As the world grapples with the unprecedented rise of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, medical professionals have struggled to find resources to care for patients. At hospitals all over Oregon, shortages of face masks, swabs, and other protective gear leave doctors and nurses risking their lives to provide adequate treatment. The crisis has gotten so dire that Providence hospitals are resorting to asking volunteers to sew medical masks by hand for caregivers.¬¨‚Ä†  Youth-Link, a student-led group striving to provide online education services for our local community during this unprecedented time, has stepped forwards to lead the effort in supporting our doctors and nurses in this critical time of need.  Our goal is to raise $8,000 to purchase 2000 surgery masks, 2000 face shields, and 2000 KN95 masks. We need your support more than ever. Already, Oregon has more than 115 cases of COVID-19 and 3 deaths. Money and facemask donations during this time will allow doctors and caregivers to continue administering treatment to those in need.¬¨‚Ä†  Please help us spread the word by contributing today and by sharing this GoFundMe. We're all in this together.  Connect with Youth-Link on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter: @youthlinkpdx",

Caf‚àö¬©s und Restaurants m‚àö¬∫ssen nun schlie‚àö√ºen, verlieren damit all ihre Einnahmen, m‚àö¬∫ssen ihre Kosten aber weiterhin tragen.   Auch meine Freundin Katrin, die sich vor 3 Jahren endlich ihren Traum von einem eigenen Caf‚àö¬© in Hamburg erf‚àö¬∫llt hat, braucht deshalb dringend finanzielle Hilfe.  Katrin hat all ihr Herzblut und ihre R‚àö¬∫cklagen in ihr Caf‚àö¬© \"\"Valentinas Backsalon\"\" im Grindelviertel gesteckt  und dort bisher gl‚àö¬∫cklichen Kunden k‚àö‚àÇstliche Kuchen und Torten serviert, die von ihr und von RentnerInnen gebacken wurden, die mit ihr arbeiten und sich so etwas zu ihrer (bekanntlich oft geringen) Rente dazuverdienen k‚àö‚àÇnnen.  Im letzten und in diesem Jahr hat sie auch abseits der Krise viele pers‚àö‚àÇnliche R‚àö¬∫ckschl‚àö¬ßge erlebt, und trotzdem bisher immer weiter gek‚àö¬ßmpft.    Katrin sieht momentan keinen Ausweg und bef‚àö¬∫rchtet, dass sie ihr kleines Caf‚àö¬© nach der Krise aufgeben muss.   Ich w‚àö¬ßre euch unheimlich dankbar, wenn ihr Katrin unterst‚àö¬∫tzen k‚àö‚àÇnntet, damit \"\"Valentinas Backsalon\"\" den Hamburgern auch nach den n‚àö¬ßchsten Wochen oder Monaten erhalten bleibt und dort weiterhin so leckere Kuchen und Torten gegessen werden k‚àö‚àÇnnen.   Bitte unterst‚àö¬∫tzt Katrin dabei, diese schwere Zeit zu ‚àö¬∫berstehen. Jeder noch so kleine Betrag hilft!

Si quieres saber m‚àö¬∞s:  Poco queda ya por explicar de la dif‚àö‚â†cil situaci‚àö‚â•n que vive el mundo actualmente. Nos encontramos ante la que probablemente sea la mayor crisis sanitaria del ‚àö‚à´ltimo siglo y, desafortunadamente, parece que tanto los sistemas de prevenci‚àö‚â•n como los de respuesta no han conseguido frenar el avance de la epidemia, vi‚àö¬©ndose ahora desbordados.  Por ese motivo, con el objetivo de minimizar el impacto de la enfermedad sobre los grupos m‚àö¬∞s vulnerables de nuestra sociedad, ayudando as‚àö‚â† a reducir la carga de trabajo de nuestro sistema sanitario, se ha puesto en marcha una iniciativa en la ciudad de Segovia para ayudar a colectivos de riesgo con las tareas que les obligasen a abandonar su domicilio, exponi‚àö¬©ndolos al virus.  Esta iniciativa, totalmente altruista, ha comenzado por ayudar a nuestros mayores a realizar la compra, utilizando para ello a voluntarios que no pertenecen a grupos de riesgo.  Actualmente, todo este esfuerzo se ve realizado por un grupo de voluntarios cada vez mayor, pero que en estos momentos se est‚àö¬∞ viendo desbordado. Adem‚àö¬∞s, al ser el proyecto totalmente altruista y no aceptar ninguna remuneraci‚àö‚â•n por el servicio, tambi‚àö¬©n se ve enormemente limitado por los recursos econ‚àö‚â•micos de los voluntarios, que son los que est‚àö¬∞n teniendo cargar con los gastos.  ¬¨‚Ä†A pesar de todo esto, hemos visto una gran respuesta social. Prueba de ello son los contactos que hemos recibido tanto de instituciones como de medios de comunicaci‚àö‚â•n para ayudar a difundir el proyecto e incluso intentar escalarlo, o los m‚àö¬∞s de 600 seguidores que se han unido a nuestras redes desde su creaci‚àö‚â•n hace dos d‚àö‚â†as. Aun as‚àö‚â†, lo que m‚àö¬∞s nos ha sorprendido ha sido la gran cantidad de gente que ha pedido informaci‚àö‚â•n para participar como voluntarios, llegando a sumar m‚àö¬∞s de 100 solicitudes.  Esto nos a hecho darnos cuenta de que para nosotros esto es solo el comienzo. Creemos firmemente que la ‚àö‚à´nica forma de acabar con esta epidemia ser‚àö¬∞ con responsabilidad social y solidaridad, por lo que esperamos que esta iniciativa pueda seguir creciendo en otras ciudades de Espa‚àö¬±a y extendi‚àö¬©ndose a un mayor n‚àö‚à´mero de colectivos de riesgo, no solo a nivel sanitario sino tambi‚àö¬©n a nivel social.  Para hacer esto posible, tanto a nivel log‚àö‚â†stico como organizativo, hemos decidido poner en marcha esta campa‚àö¬±a para que el que lo desee pueda colaborar con nuestro proyecto. De esta forma podr‚àö¬©is aportar a la iniciativa sin salir de casa, financiando desde material sanitario, que nos permite proporcionar el servicio de forma segura, hasta gastos de transporte, con los que podremos ampliar nuestro radio de actuaci‚àö‚â•n, pudiendo as‚àö‚â† cubrir un porcentaje mayor de la poblaci‚àö‚â•n de riesgo.  Tambi‚àö¬©n quer‚àö‚â†amos puntualizar que cualquier excedente de este crowdfunding ser‚àö¬∞ devuelto al sistema p‚àö‚à´blico para que pueda ser utilizado para paliar las consecuencias de esta crisis, ya que el objetivo de esta iniciativa nunca ha sido el enriquecimiento personal de los involucrados.  Nos gustar‚àö‚â†a agradecer de antemano todas las donaciones, as‚àö‚â† como cualquier otra forma de colaboraci‚àö‚â•n. En estos momentos toda ayuda es bienvenida, ya sea con una aportaci‚àö‚â•n econ‚àö‚â•mica o ayudando en tareas de organizaci‚àö‚â•n, gesti‚àö‚â•n de redes, asesoramiento sanitario,... Estamos siempre disponibles a trav‚àö¬©s de nuestras redes para escuchar vuestras ideas sobre nuevas formas de aportar. Si  Por ‚àö‚à´ltimo, a‚àö¬±adir que si existiese alguien interesado en intentar replicar la iniciativa en otras ciudades, estaremos encantados de ayudar aportando toda la informaci‚àö‚â•n que hemos ido desarrollando en los ‚àö‚à´ltimos d‚àö‚â†as en lo que respecta a procesos, implementaci‚àö‚â•n, desarrollo,‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ de un proyecto de estas caracter‚àö‚â†sticas.

            "description": "Hello, This is Richies story, he was born 7 weeks early. Mom went through California testing and everything seemed good with baby and no reason to worry besides a little fluid in his kidneys. Mom was monitored weekly and the issue seemed to be resolving itself.  When Richie was prematurely born, they told us the issue was still there along with 3 other defects. Since our baby had so many issues all together at once, they called in a geneticist and took blood samples. We were interrogated and asked a series of questions, after 3 weeks of emotional torture finally they had a result for us. The doctors said Richie has a very rare syndrome with only 300 cases reported in the world. By definition individuals with this rare syndrome have difficulty eating, so automatically all efforts to teach my premature baby to eat by the nurses were diminished. They put a tube in his nose and my son was barely given a chance. Doctors insisted that we would have to leave the NICU with a Gtube in order to successfully feed Richie.  After weeks of arguing with rude nurses and being there for our son, we proved to them that he didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need a tube in his stomach. We spent 7 weeks in an understaffed hospital with no bedside manner and gossipy nurses. They fed my baby cold breast milk and they also relied heavily on sugar water packets to calm down babies. It was a horrible experience and now my baby is suffering from all of it on top of the syndrome. He was repeatedly pricked on the hands and feet, he was around nurses and doctors who lost hope in him but he will prevail.  I know Richie will move mountains and I will help him along the way. I want to be able to get Richie the best help possible but my insurance unfortunately does not cover the physical therapy my son requires for his age along with other services he needs. We visit several specialists, he has started treatment for his surgery, we have several copays and medications and as much as I would like to be able to cover this myself it has become a little bit hard. We need help for Richies pediatric therapies and surgery but above all we need your prayers for our little boy. Thank you for time and support, any help we receive is greatly appreciated.",

Today we have just been informed our Lockdown will be extended past the original 15 day deadline, we have no idea when this will end‚Äö√Ñ¬∂.

At 2:01am on Tuesday morning, a day that was supposed to be filled with Irish cheer and whiskey chasers, we closed the doors to our businesses for the foreseeable future. And while we have emptied our coolers, drained our taps and prepared ourselves for the long haul we still have a very major concern on our minds- the awesome staff of bartenders and door hosts at  The Standard Tavern  and  Stella's; A Cocktail Dive.    These are the same amazing people that have helped us raise funds for a countless number of charities and different families of our neighborhood and community. They man our grills, run chili cook offs and even shave your head for mustache roulette. They are the smiling faces that greet you after a long day and have your drink order halfway ready before you even find your favorite bar stool.¬¨‚Ä† They are a fantastic group and its for these people that we are asking for help today.   We are asking for any help to ease some of their burden of rent/bills and stress of not knowing what tomorrow may bring for them.¬¨‚Ä† We are asking to give them a little bit of peace of mind in a very dark time. All of the funds raised will be distributed between the bartenders and door hosts. If you are able to help, please do. If you aren't, we absolutely understand and we hope that you have everything that you need to get through this crazy time. Please reach out if you need anything. Stay in touch. When this is all over we hope to catch up with all of you over some whiskey. Until then, stay safe and stay well.¬¨‚Ä†  #TheStandardTavern #Stellas",

Due to this coronavirus pandemic, many people who are employed in hospitality will have no access to funds to buy groceries and some other basic necessities. Bartenders and other employees who depend on tips and bars and restaurants being open are going through a rough time. As a small business, with three locations (Bed-Vyne Wine, Bed-Vyne Brew, Bed-Vyne Cocktail) we ask that you help us by donating any amount you can so that we can help our employees cover some basic needs. The money collected will be distributed evenly among our bartenders who have been displaced and currently not working. I was inspired to start this gofundme by my friend Victoria who reached and volunteered to donate $50.00 to any bartenders who may need groceries. We already planned on doing this as a business but once I heard from Victoria, I figured maybe there are others willing to help. Hence this platform. Thanks for your help. Everyone please be safe. We will get through this with help from God and everyone taking the necessary precautions. Thank you from all of us at Bed-Vyne¬¨‚Ä†  rotimi¬¨‚Ä† ayo pete damone mike    ¬¨‚Ä†",

Considering the hard hit especially for a newly open brick-and-mortar, Julie Myrtille needs a little help from you to go through this global crisis .     How can you help ?   Today you can support a small woman business and donate now for this relief fund and/or share this to your friend and Family.    With all our love and gratitude ‚Äö√¥‚Ä¢ Julie Myrtille and the bakery team",

After that she begins with radiation for 2 weeks causing her liver and pancreas to become inflamed, furthermore spreading to her uterus and her lungs. Even though she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s had bad diagnostics, my mom is a warrior and she really wants to keep fighting. This week we will be taking my mom to MD Anderson Hospital in Houston, Tx where they have the best cancer doctors. The cost of the treatments have been high and the cost to go to Houston will be even higher, which is why I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m asking for help. Any help you can give to my mom to¬¨‚Ä† keep on fighting.

Currently, local hospitals are in dire need of supplies. Over the past week, frontline workers have been directed to buy and make their own protective gear -- bandanas as face masks, ski goggles as protective eyewear, and rags and towels instead of sanitizing wipes. Healthcare workers are scrambling to get PPE (N-95 masks, surgical masks, face shields, gloves, surgical scrub caps, etc) in every and any way possible.¬¨‚Ä†  We have started a community fundraiser to help in order to help frontline workers procure PPE as well as materials for alternative protection measures, and we are asking for your financial help in this time.¬¨‚Ä†   If you have supplies to donate:¬¨‚Ä†  Please consider donating supplies. Anything that is not being used currently at (your place of business, school, worship, construction site, brewery, etc) could be helpful and greatly increase the level of care these hospital workers can provide. In order for this to be effective, we need a large community effort, immediately.    What do we need?

Thousands of cases have been reported in China, with a small number in countries including the United States, Thailand and Singapore.  The unprecedented move prompted people in the city of 11 million to rush to supermarkets to stock up on instant noodles, vegetables and whatever else they could put their hands on.  Residents say there has yet to be an acute shortage of food, although shelves are cleared quickly when goods arrive.  Shouguang, the country‚Äö√Ñ√¥s biggest vegetable production base, in the eastern Shandong province, has been asked to deliver 600 tons of fresh vegetables to Wuhan every day in the next 10 to 15 days, said an official in Sunjiaji, one of Shouguang‚Äö√Ñ√¥s villages.  Sunjiaji, whose main crop is cucumbers, was tasked with sending 60 tons in less than seven hours.  China‚Äö√Ñ√¥s largest food and agricultural firm COFCO Group and China Grain Reserves Corporation (Sinograin) Group have stepped up supplies of rice, meat and cooking oil to Hubei province  wuhan You need this kind of help to provide masks and food for the most needy",

To provide this care we need to protect ourselves and you all through the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to curtail the spread of this virus .  ¬¨‚Ä†We are a group of resident physicians at Jackson Memorial Hospital, a public trust hospital for Miami-Dade County and the 3rd largest hospital in the United States. We, along with other health professionals, are at the front lines of the COVID-19 epidemic working tirelessly to provide the best care we can to our patients; this is our honor and our oath.   Currently, one of the biggest concerns is the diminishing quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks, gowns, gloves, and face shields. Cases continue to increase exponentially, and PPE allows health care workers to limit the spread further ¬¨‚Ä†  As it stands, Miami-Dade has the highest amount of cases in the state of Florida and the predicted trajectory is only upwards in the coming weeks. With a lack of protective gear, we not only put the health of Miami in jeopardy, we also put ourselves in danger of not being able to serve our community due to transmission.¬¨‚Ä†  We are fundraising to get the PPE that is essential for us to maintain the workforce to treat our patients in a safe manner, prevent spread in hospitals, and provide safety for the community.¬¨‚Ä†  PPE costs approximately $40 per box. We recognize that this is a difficult and scary time for many people- economically, emotionally, and physically. We will not give up and we are committed to the health of Miami-Dade.  Our team appreciates any support, donation, or sharing of this message. Any help you can offer is greatly appreciated and will go a long way in helping us keep our community safe.   Please, please stay home if you can, utilize social distancing, stay safe, and wash those hands!  As we work as a community, This too shall pass.   ¬¨‚Ä†",

We founded our company with three major goals:  1. To make a difference in the way people view Latin American countries and their people.¬¨‚Ä†   2. To change up who is benefiting from tourism by putting more money into the hands of small businesses, artists, and artisans.¬¨‚Ä†  3. To reduce our negative impact on the environment when traveling.  ¬¨‚Ä†   HOW LONG HAS HEART BEEN AROUND?¬¨‚Ä†   Heart of Travel was founded in November of 2016 but we really got rolling as a company in July of 2017 when Ana \"\"Chiva\"\" Castillo, born and raised in Guatemala, came aboard as co-founder. Over the past three years, we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve seen steady growth and increased success thanks to our amazing team and loyal supporters. In November of 2019, we were recognized by the Guatemalan Institute of Tourism as one of the top 7 small businesses with the greatest potential to make an impact on responsible and sustainable tourism.  At Heart of Travel, we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve always been the underdogs and challenges are nothing new to us. From earthquakes to volcanic eruptions, a tense global political climate and a lack of funding opportunities for women and POC - we have always persevered and found a way to overcome any obstacle put in our path.   ¬¨‚Ä†   BUT NOW WE ARE IN TROUBLE AND NEED YOUR HELP!¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†   Nothing could have prepared us for COVID-19. In the past two weeks, our sales have dropped by 98% and emails to cancel and postpone trips have been flooding in. People are understandably scared and Heart of Travel is taking a very prudent stance of not promoting travel between now and August in order to help slow the spread of the virus and not put our employees, clients and freelance providers at risk. You can read our entire official statement regarding COVID-19 here:   https://www.facebook.com/theheartoftravel   We are determined to keep fighting but there is also no denying the numbers. Co-founders, Chelsea and Chiva, will be taking a 20% salary cut, with no reduction in hours, while other staff members have volunteered to take up to a 32% reduction in hours worked in order to lower operating costs in the coming months - a gesture that we greatly appreciate and that makes us that much more motivated to keep these wonderful people employed.¬¨‚Ä†  Even with strategies to cut costs, if we tap into savings and max out our modest credit line we can still only get through 2 months with little to no sales before having to lay people off. We know the world will recover in the coming months from this global economic and health crisis but in order to keep the lights on and avoid layoffs in the meantime, we need your help!¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä†   HOW CAN YOU HELP HEART OF TRAVEL?¬¨‚Ä†   1. Sign up for a trip! Trips from August 2020 onwards are still available for registration and for all 2020 trips we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve introduced a new more flexible refund policy. See trips currently available here:¬¨‚Ä†  www.heartoftravel.org/group-tours/  2. Write us a review on Tripadvisor so that when things pick back up we will get a rush of sales on day and weekend tours here in Guatemala!¬¨‚Ä† See our Tripadvisor page here:   https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295366-d15188367-Reviews-Heart_of_Travel-Antigua_Sacatepequez_Department.html   3. Follow us on social media and share our website and social media accounts with your friends. We will be pumping out lots of fun and useful content in the coming months to build our social media following in hopes to grow our community and boost sales when people begin to travel again!¬¨‚Ä†   instagram: ¬¨‚Ä†@heart_of_travel¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†   facebook: ¬¨‚Ä†facebook.com/theheartoftravel¬¨‚Ä†   website: ¬¨‚Ä†www.heartoftravel.org¬¨‚Ä†  4. Donate to this crowdfunding effort! Even if you just donate a small portion of what you would have spent on travel this year you can help us stay afloat.   ¬¨‚Ä†   HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE USED?¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†   Funds will be used to cover payroll and office operational costs over the next four months in order to avoid layoffs as we continue designing new itineraries and planning future trips as well as creating more useful and interesting travel-related content for Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest and the Heart of Travel blog!   But this doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t just affect us here at Heart! The entire tourism community is in crisis and there are many small businesses, freelance guides, artists and artisans who rely on Heart of Travel for a portion of their income. Therefore, a portion of all funds raised will be utilized for a mini ‚Äö√Ñ√∫stimulus‚Äö√Ñ√π program where we will donate the equivalent of the average monthly income generated via Hearts tours to the freelancers and artisans who we work with on a regular basis to help soften the blow.¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä†   YOU HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP HEART AND OUR EXTENDED FAMILY AFLOAT DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTS PANDEMIC!¬¨‚Ä†   From the bottom of our hearts, thank you so all so much!

            "description": "( CLICK HERE TO VISIT SAMARITAN'S LAUNCH PAGE! ¬¨‚Ä†)  This is me and my 88 y.o. grandparents who emigrated from the Soviet Union so my family could live insurmountably better lives. My grandma was the one who taught me to see the good in everything and the kindness in peoples' hearts. My grandpa was the one who taught me to use my imagination and build things for my neighbors to relish. Needless to say,  I love them to death . And with the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic and the American government's incredibly slow response system, for my babushka and dedushka,  I am now scared to death .      What is Samaritan?   I was calling my grandparents one day, urging them to wash their hands whenever they came home from running errands, when I thought of  Samaritan . I knew there are millions of people in need who don't have caretakers or loved ones to readily provide them with necessities, and with this came the idea for an app that  connects those in need with samaritans willing to help .  Samaritan will be a completely free, ad-less platform for those in need, or Receivers, to be aided by samaritans in their areas. The latter will bring food, packages, and other supplies to those who are quarantined, out of the goodness of their hearts.    ¬¨‚Ä†  What about Evil People?   In other words, what will happen if people misuse the platform to acquire goods and services? I completely acknowledge the security risks that come with this completely free platform, and am implementing the following to mitigate misuse:  - Samaritan and Receiver  rating system  - Login through  verified accounts  (Facebook and Google) -  (Future)   Background checks  with Passport Photos/Driver's Licences  That being said, there will still be numerous ways for people to use the platform for the wrong reasons. I implore early users to  flag suspicious accounts  and to  call Receivers on the phone prior to exchanges  to ensure the safety of both parties.   How to deal with community spread through this app?   Samaritans will be  onboarded with procedures on avoiding direct contact  with Receivers, as well as  best practices  for navigating the streets during times of quarantine. Extra security measures will also be put in place to  ensure the COVID-19-negative-status of  Samaritans. Of course, the app and its creators  will not be liable for accidental spread , but we urge users to use this platform for the greater good.   What if this flops?   If there really is no kindness left in the world amidst this pandemic, I pledge to  donate all remaining funds  from this GoFundMe campaign to the  American Red Cross .",

We have made the difficult decision to close our doors effective Sunday, March 22nd. It was a really hard decision to make. Being in the service industry, we pride ourselves on serving the community and giving them what they want and need. However, we cannot allow our staff to risk exposure to COVID-19. We cannot allow ourselves to risk getting our families sick. We have a 6 year old daughter and a 2 year old daughter, as well as parents with pre-existing health conditions. We cannot afford to risk their lives staying open. We know that we will reopen again, but we cannot do that without a completely healthy team. We don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know when we will reopen.   Operating on margins as thin as ours, this means that our employees don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know when they will get their next checks. We are starting this fund to help support all of our employees. All of the money collected will go to staff and will not be used for the restaurant or the owners benefit. We understand that it is a hard time for everyone but if you have anything to spare, no amount is too small. It breaks our hearts that our staff have to figure out how to pay for their rent, utilities, groceries, etc. and many of them have children to support as well.   Please, if you haven‚Äö√Ñ√¥t already, reach out to your local congressmen and state government. Restaurants are in dire need of help. #toosmalltofail   We appreciate all of the love we have received thus far. Thank you for making our dreams reality and supporting our small mom and pop.

            "description": "Hello All,   I've been seeing and hearing alot of stories of the elderly and those with disabilities not willing to leave their home so get basic essentials to survive.  In light of this, i'm starting this fundraiser. The money will be used to help these in our local community purchase the basic essentials. Things we all take for granted like bread, milk, frozen, tea, sugar, shower products.¬¨‚Ä†  Our elderly, our parents, grand parents, friends   family are all at risk if they're over the age of 60. Most of these will not leave the house because they're scared for their own health. As a community, we should pull together and do what we can to help these people.  I will be looking at local volunteers to help drive essentials to various addresses around Derby. Part of the funds will be used to cover Fuel Costs, the remaining funds will be used to help give our most vulnerable the essentials they so desperately need.   Breakdown of what the money will be used for:  Basic Essentials: Cleaning Products, Bread, Milk, Tea/Coffee, Shower Products, Meals. Collections for the Elderly e.g. Basic pain killers Taxi's where appropriate for delivery of items where no one is available to volunteer. Fuel Costs  Every penny counts and every penny will be used. It's times like this where we must pull together as a community and help each other. You never know when it could be you or i in this situation needing help.",

Normally known for a¬¨‚Ä† hustling-bustling country that we so dearly cherish, the nation's regular life is halted in many aspects and impacting wider population significantly. The underprivileged - a signification portion of the population caught up in this unwanted catastrophe - are battling to make ends meet.    Who  All hand-to-mouth wage earners - from Rickshaw puller to Nut seller, from Hawker to Day Labour, from Homeless to Maids, all are facing a grim reality of hunger as their income is rapidly dwindling due to less demand of their services. In addition, the hoarding disorder of rich few pushed the price of essential items unreachable for poor many.  This is our little effort to fight this calamity by offering a helping hand to those who have nowhere else go.   How  The plan is to deploy volunteers to locate the most vulnerable ones across Dhaka city. They will then help those poor ones getting the essentials to go on for few days - e.g. rice, lentils, potatoes, onion etc. No cash will be given out.¬¨‚Ä† The volunteers will ensure their own safety before engaging with people.

Like many small businesses within the service industry, our employees collect tips, which are the primary source of their livelihoods. Being forced to close due to the current crisis has put a significant drain on their cash flow. As a company, we are working hard to find ways to continue to support our team and to ensure we can return to full strength just as soon as the 'all clear' has been given. Please help the family of Brandy Library by simply pledging what you would normally tip during a stay with your favorite bartender, sommelier, server, etc. All gifts collected will go directly to our hourly employees to offset their lost wages. We appreciate your generosity and look forward to seeing you in our beautiful lounge of amber spirits very soon!",

            "description": "Our dear friend Jen's catering business has been severely affected by the Covid-19 outbreak in Seattle. As the epicenter in the US for the virus, all of Jen's catering jobs have been canceled or postponed resulting in severe financial hardship for her and her kids. Jen started the Salted Fig 3 years ago with the goal of providing high quality, affordable meals to individuals and groups.   As soon as the virus hit, clients immediately started canceling - first catering and then her personal chef clients. Seattle has so far been the city hardest hit by the COVID-19 coronavirus. This scary and tragic time has a lot of people staying close to home in order to try to help prevent the spread of this virus that can be devastating to our elderly, disabled, and medically compromised friends and neighbors.   The widespread cancellation of group events has had a disproportionate impact on small businesses - especially those who are in the service industry. Jen's very existence relies on what she creates and having regular clients to rely on. As a woman-owned, small business Jen does not have the ability to take sustain such severe hardship. If you love Seattle and have the resources to help - please consider donating. Every little bit helps.",

            "description": "  Aulder Family and Friends,  Over the past several weeks, COVID - 19 has had a dramatic impact on the livelihood of millions of families across the world.  The disease has not only put many of our residents at medical risk, but it has also had a substantial economic impact on their day to day lives.  In all of the communities where we own real estate, schools have been closed for the foreseeable future putting meal distribution programs to children at risk. Local government and school districts are working with organizations to provide food and set up distance learning, but this is a huge undertaking as hundreds of families struggle with the immediate impacts including loss of jobs, food security, and child care and schools.¬¨‚Ä† As community partners, we want to support the ongoing efforts to provide for our residents while long term plans are made and put into action.  The Aulder/ZPM Social Impact Committee and our employees on-site have been able to provide ¬¨‚Ä† $2,800 worth of food   to supplement the lost breakfast and lunches and   $700 worth of activity books and crayons   to keep the kids busy while learning plans are drawn up .   Many residents have accepted the gifts with tears in their eyes, one such resident said,   \"\" Thanks to the employees, I did not have to search for lunch for the great grand kids today. Thank you, thank you\"\"  . We hope to continue supporting our residents and do everything in our power to mitigate the impact which this pandemic is having on the health and wellness of our communities.¬¨‚Ä†   But now, we are reaching out for your help to allow us to continue providing for our residents while the long term plans are implemented and especially ensuring the most vulnerable during this time (children and elderly) are being supported.¬¨‚Ä†   Please see below for a detailed description of how we plan on using the funds:   1) Distribution of healthy food to residents (including snacks, breakfast and lunch)   Specific food delivery and pick up times will be announced on a weekly basis, and all food will be distributed in a responsible manner.   2) Elderly resident check in / resource support   We plan on calling each of our elderly residents and asking them if they need any assistance or have specific goods or services which they need. Our onsite team will use resources available to provide the proper support.¬¨‚Ä†  If you are interested in volunteering to call residents, please fill out this interest form:¬¨‚Ä†  Link to Volunteer ¬¨‚Ä†    3) Educational activities to be distributed to children (activity books, reading books, brain games, arts and crafts materials, etc.).¬¨‚Ä†   Many of our community‚Äö√Ñ√¥s children have little to do on a day to day basis - our goal is to provide them with educational activities which they can enjoy during this time of social distancing.¬¨‚Ä†   4) Supplement Technology / E Learning¬¨‚Ä†   The majority of schools have moved to an ‚Äö√Ñ√∫E - Learning‚Äö√Ñ√π platform but many of our residents do not have access to computers or tablets to participate. We hope to support these students with access to computers, tablets, and wifi to continue their studies in their homes.¬¨‚Ä†  More than half of American jobs are at risk, with limited income and the risk of food shortage, we want to assure we are doing everything we can to make a difference in our resident‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lives.   Every donation will be greatly appreciated.¬¨‚Ä†    Sincerely,  Michael Zito",

Over the last 20 years, we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve worked every position in the kitchen. I know the value of hard work and the determination it takes to persevere. I also appreciate the bonds we make as we all traverse our own path. For Jason, it's buying a new pair of shoes for a prep cook or giving his crew members a ride home after working a double. It's about COMMUNITY.... . . In these uncertain times amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, many of you are figuring out the best way to keep your family safe, especially those who have weakened immune systems or are more susceptible to becoming ill if confronted with the virus.... . . We want to offer aid   an option for you   your elderly neighbor or whomever. My fianc‚àö¬©e and I have nearly 35 years combined experience in the food service industry. We've managed and operated within some of the top restaurants that emphasize dietary and allergen certification processes¬¨‚Ä† and focus on sanitation training......and, of course, DELICIOUS food!!.... . . We are offering our private cooking services to all those in need, and here's why we're different:  1. We have access to an empty private kitchen - we will be the only ones preparing your food 2. We order our food from commercial food purveyors - no crowded grocery shopping or fear of running out of supplies 3. We offer fast and contactless delivery. 4. We can prepare recipes and meal prep so you can cook at home or we'll cook for you; daily and weekly planning available. Do you have extremely picky eaters? We'll even cook your tried and true family recipes!!! REPLY for more info and menu options.   ***This effort is donation based so we can help those in need. This is a not for profit endeavor, however we will use any excess donations to cover incidentals and basic living expenses, so that we can help as many people as possible and continue our efforts as long as there is a demand. ***   PLEASE FORWARD THIS IF YOU KNOW OF ANY ELDERLY OR HOME BOUND RESIDENTS THAT NEED HELP!

            "description": "Help us provide a helping hand to those whose financial security has been significantly impacted by COVID-19.¬¨‚Ä†   COVID-19 is rapidly changing our social and financial landscape in Halifax, the impacts of which are being disproportionately felt by those who were already living on the edge of financial insecurity.  Employees are being told to stay home as events are cancelled, services suspended, schools closed. Those working in service industries remain vulnerable, but are now dealing with more limited patronage as Haligonians begin to socially isolate.  Many among us have already been struggling, and are now facing unprecedented financial challenges with limited opportunities to earn additional wages.  However, some of us are better positioned to cope with COVID-19. Some of us are financially secure. More than that, some of us have more than we need, want to help others who are less financially secure, and are looking for a forum to do so.  And so, Helping Hand HRM. The idea is simple - those who are financially able, consider donating to this Go Fund Me. All funds will go to those whose financial security has been significantly impacted by COVID-19 to fulfill their short-term financial needs indicated through our Instagram account.  Those in need should  DM the Helping Hand HRM Instagram account ¬¨‚Ä†and let us know what you need. Money for rent? Groceries? A hydro bill? Indicate the amount, and we will use the funds donated to this Go Fund Me to help to the best of our abilities.   Funds will be distributed on a needs basis. That is to say, we will try and meet the financial need indicated by each person, rather than distributing funds equally to everyone who reaches out.  Any funds donated greater than the needs of community members will be donated to local food banks.  Thank you for reading - please share widely!  Follow us on Instagram at  Helping Hand HRM",

If a donation isn't possible, please share this fundraiser if it is in your heart to do so.    In deep gratitude for the Kula Tribe.    https://www.kulayogashala.com  ¬¨‚Ä†  A note from our brewmaster, Scott Feinberg...¬¨‚Ä†  \"\"After much consideration of many different angles and giving deep thought about what constitutes most authentically embodying the teachings we collectively cherish, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve made the decision that the most responsible way for us to support the health of our community is to temporarily close our shala, for the time being, beginning this Tuesday. In the spirit of ahimsa (the foundational yogic principle of non-violence), it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s important that we do not contribute to the unintended spreading of the coronavirus within our community. While in many ways this is a difficult decision, I believe it is the right one.  Yoga comes in many forms. So does community. This is an unprecedented time in our lives and calls upon our capacity to recognize that the most powerful way to support our community is by staying home over the coming days and curbing the spread of the virus. It is simply too much risk to even have willing students and teachers share a practice space when non-symptomatic carriers may spread the virus and in turn impact the lives of others in our community, especially our highly vulnerable elders.  I do not have an exact date that we will re-open our doors as we will continue to monitor the situation and make the wisest decision based upon the fluid nature of this crisis. If we can all stick together through this and do our part, we will hopefully be back practicing together sooner rather than later.  We are looking into online options for Kula classes and as we progress in our research we will, of course, keep you informed. Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s be creative in how we can keep sewing the threads of conscious, heart-centered community in new ways. Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s continue to support one another even as we may have different views in regard to what constitutes appropriate action. Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s help one another through this time as we will need that more and more and in varied forms in the coming weeks and months. And most of all let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s continue to stand with integrity and in loving kindness as we make our way through this together.\"\"   With Community At Heart,  ¬¨‚Ä†  Scott",

There is no telling how long things will last, or what shape they might take in the future. But now is the time to band together, to help those in need.

I am looking for help because it is not only the tuition fees that I need to pay but also the rent and some amenities to support my live in Barcelona.  The economic situation in Spain actually been worst since the last week of february, the tourist stop coming, many event cancelled and it is true that most companies are afraid of hiring new emloyees. So it was already difficult for me to find the part time and temporary job. Then with the situation in Spain now, all the  job vancancies are closed , they  stopped the part time job , and even the  demand of freelancing  on the internet  are going down (even cancelled!).   I cannot go back either because it will put risk on my family, the airlines cancelling the flight (if there is any it would be super expensive because it will put risk for all the poeple on the airplane), and the goverment start to close the border. I cannot ask my family the money, because the economic situation is not affected only in Spain but global, so the currency also change.¬¨‚Ä†  If you could help me to solve my situation I will be appreciated a lot. The  minimun you can donate is 5‚Äö√á¬®.  If by the end I will end up with more than my target and  manage to pay for my tution and rent  I will use the rest of the money to help people fight¬¨‚Ä† the corona in Spain. Because I noticed that we are also running out of mask, gloves, and medic due to the number that keep increasing in Spain, 1000 people are affected per day! I need to take care of myself however, I don't want to be selfish to think of only me while others are also fighting their lives.",

            "description": "Christie and I have been thinking through ways to support the greater Cambridge community through this time of uncertainty and heightened anxiety.¬¨‚Ä†  We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve decided that we want to raise money for the  Cambridge COVID-19 Emergency Fund  , set up by the  Cambridge Community Foundation ¬¨‚Ä† in partnership with the  City of Cambridge ¬¨‚Ä†.   How does it work?  The emergency fund will deploy grants (up to $1,000) to Cambridge residents   workers experiencing financial hardship related to COVID-19. In addition, grants of up to $10,000 will be awarded to nonprofits that directly work with low-income populations and that have the capacity to make money transfers to the constituents they serve.¬¨‚Ä†    http://cambridgecf.org/COVID-19-emergency-fund  ¬¨‚Ä†   http://cambridgecf.org/two-new-funds-launched-in-response-to-covid-19/  ¬¨‚Ä†   https://www.cambridgema.gov/news/2020/03/mayorscovid19fund  ¬¨‚Ä†   How much will we raise?  We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re aiming to raise $2,000 between now and the end of the month. Christie and I are planning to match donations, up to $500, and our friends, Ezer Lee and Eric   Kelly Dearing have also graciously offered to match another $500 each. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s $1,500 in matching donations!   Pilates Mat Class on Instagram Live  As a part of our fundraising efforts,  Christie will be hosting a charity Pilates Mat class on Instagram Live  this Thursday (3/26) at 7:30 AM (which will then be live for 24 hrs)   https://www.instagram.com/fitwithchristie/  ¬¨‚Ä†  //   Would you consider making a contribution of $10 or $25 to support those who have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic?   If you've been blessed with financial security, and you're looking for ways to be generous, would you consider making a contribution of $50 or $100, or even becoming a matching donor?  If you can't make a contribution at this time, please help share this effort with those you know, especially those who live, work, or play in Cambridge!  //   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS    Why is this a personal fundraiser?  Setting up a GoFundMe fundraiser to go to CCF directly would mean that the funds wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t actually get to them until April 30th, because of GoFundMe's payout timelines. We believe that getting the funds raised as quickly as possible is worth the associated trade-offs.   How will you get the money to CCF?  When the fundraiser closes on March 31st, we will donate all the proceeds  directly to the CCF on their website  , and share the donation details publicly. The online donation goes through  Network For Good, which will send the funds to CCF on April 15th ¬¨‚Ä†.   What if I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to give through GoFundMe?  You can venmo Emmanuel-Runes or Christie-Wang-3, and we will donate to the GoFundMe on your behalf.   Is my donation tax-deductible?  Unfortunately, one of the trade-offs of speed is that these donations are not tax-deductible. If that's important to you, we recommend  donating directly !  https://cambridgecf.networkforgood.com/projects/95764-cambridge-covid-19-emergency-fund    Are there fees?  Unfortunately, another one of the trade-offs of speed is that these donations incur a 2.9% fee + $0.30 USD.¬¨‚Ä†  //   CHARITY PILATES MAT CLASS ON INSTAGRAM LIVE    What will the Pilates Mat class be like?  This will be a 45 minute bodyweight full body Pilates mat class. Pilates, originally invented by a man named Joseph Pilates during the 1920s, is a low impact form of conditioning - working the full body, especially the core.   What do I need for the Pilates Mat Class?  ¬¨‚Ä†- Yoga Mat or Towel to pad your knees/tailbone ¬¨‚Ä†- Phone or device to access Instagram¬¨‚Ä†   Any tips for taking the Pilates Mat Class?  ¬¨‚Ä†- Place the device at the front of your mat for the best angle. ¬¨‚Ä†- Use the largest device you have (iPad) or consider mirroring your screen to a TV¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†- Make sure to listen closely to cues and instruction, as visuals can sometimes lag - Although the class airs at 7:30 AM, it will be available for 24 hours after. If you do decide to take the class after it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s live, we hope you still consider donating!¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†- Have fun!¬¨‚Ä†  //   CAMBRIDGE COVID-19 EMERGENCY FUND    Where can I find more information about the Cambridge COVID-19 Emergency Fund?    http://cambridgecf.org/COVID-19-emergency-fund  ¬¨‚Ä†   http://cambridgecf.org/two-new-funds-launched-in-response-to-covid-19/  ¬¨‚Ä†   Who can apply for grants?  Individuals/households who live or work in Cambridge can apply to the fund and receive a grant of up to $1,000.¬¨‚Ä†   What organizations can apply for grants?  A limited number of special grants of up to $10,000 will be considered to nonprofit organizations, based on the following criteria:¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†- Track record of working with low‚Äö√Ñ√¨income families¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†- The ability to make cash transfers to individuals and families for a range of needs such as rent shortage, food, utilities, medicines/medical supplies ¬¨‚Ä†- Evidence of 501c3 status   When will funds be available?  The CCF is looking to deploy this money immediately to offer relief to those in desperate need. Grants will be provided on a rolling basis, with the first allocations expected to be made as soon as possible.¬¨‚Ä†   What‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the selection process?  The CCF has a grant review process whereby community reviewers are invited to help Foundation staff review the applications and make recommendations. Each application will be reviewed by one external reviewer and one Foundation staff person. As the fiduciary agent responsible for the use of these funds, the CCF will have the final decision on all grants.   How is the CCF Fund different from the Mayor‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Disaster Relief Fund?  The City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Community Foundation have a long-standing tradition of working together.¬¨‚Ä† These funds are complementary, allowing the CCF to deepen their reach and enabling many more people to be part of collective giving with the aim of supporting as many people as they can who need help. The CCF can support people who make their livelihood Cambridge who may not necessarily live here. The CCF can also support nonprofits and faith-based organizations that have deep reach into the community.    https://www.cambridgema.gov/news/2020/03/mayorscovid19fund",

            "description": "The San Francisco Flower Market is a historical institution that was first established in 1912 in the Financial District in SF. In 1924 it relocated to 5th   Howard, and proceeded to move to 6th   Brannan in 1956. ¬¨‚Ä†It is one of 5 total flower markets in the United States, and the second largest next to the Los Angeles Flower Market. Vendors supply flowers, plants, containers, and more as far north as Oregon, as far east as Nevada, and as far south as the central coast of California. ¬¨‚Ä†The customer base consists of event planners, retail florists, interior decorators, caterers, plant shops, and flower wholesalers.  This shutdown affects an employment base of over 300 employees, with many vendors being small, local, family-owned businesses. There are just under 50 vendors within the flower market that are facing a monumental loss due to the fact that the primary product that is for sale is highly perishable. Preserving any product is nearly impossible. The flower market is a unique institution that brings together an incredibly diverse group of people, and contains many first generation micro businesses ¬¨‚Ä†   The money collected will be evenly distributed to each vendor based on their number of employees to aid in payroll expenses.¬¨‚Ä†     About the San Francisco Flower Market:  A need for a centrally located market bringing together the three ethnically diverse groups of flower growers was fulfilled with the opening of a market located at 5th and Howard Streets in 1924. As flower growers expanded production areas outside of the Bay Area and as product from other parts of United States came in, the need for a larger more modern permanent facility led to the design and construction of our current market at Sixth and Brannan Streets in the South of Market area of San Francisco.  The grand opening of the San Francisco Flower Terminal in September 1956 marked the establishment of an industry icon. Today, officially known as the San Francisco Flower Mart, we now have just under 50 vendors, purveyors of cut flowers, potted plants, blooming plants and floral supplies.   Founded by Japanese immigrant flower growers at the turn of the century, the story of the California Flower Market, Inc. spans nearly the entire history of Japanese in America.¬¨‚Ä† Through depressions, earthquakes, racial hostility, restrictive legislation and internment during World War II, the members of the California Flower Market have overcome adversity to serve the growers who built a thriving industry from the ground up.

            "description": "Under normal circumstances, the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood gets ignored and under-resourced, following a longstanding pattern of cities underserving black and brown communities. Now that the COVID-19 crisis has hit and food has become even more scarce for poor and homeless San Franciscans, Bayview-Hunters Point is more in need than ever. There has been very little help from the City government for the Bayview, even though District 10 which includes it has over 1,500 unsheltered homeless people.     Mother Brown's Dining Room (operated by United Council of Human Services) is a 24/7 drop-in center that has provided meals, showers, and a warm place to sit to the community for decades. Mother Brown's is one of the few homeless service providers in the neighborhood, and they have done everything they can to keep up with the COVID-19 crisis, but they need your help to staff up, provide more meals, and ensure hygiene facilities can be used safely.

Understanding that the public agencies are focused on the healthcare, without a doubt that is a priority; we want to attract your attention and generosity to avert another knock-on disaster in terms of joblessness and unemployment, leading to social disorder and unrest.  Our group is well coordinated and we are building small local team to maximize help. If you can fund us that would be great, if you can't, just look after the closest person you know who has lost a job.   We truly want to help you all out there but our resources are limited. So long world's generosity lasts, we will continue to support you.   Thank you and let's help thy neighbor.

One of the biggest challenges that has emerged with the gig economy, and in this case specifically, concerns freelance performers. Musicians, dancers, and actors have all lost money-making opportunities that were a guaranteed source of income and without which, many will not be able to pay rent, provide for healthcare, and take care of many essential needs. With no provision in place through an umbrella organization and compounded by an increasing number of concert/performance cancellations, our community needs support.¬¨‚Ä†  This fundraiser aims to provide funds for performers who will not be able to make ends meet without these opportunities. We (the creators of this fund) will use the following parameters:¬¨‚Ä†  1. Funds will provided to those affected in the Philadelphia/New York City/New Jersey regions.¬¨‚Ä†  2. The fundraiser will last from March 12th until April 15th and encompass any and all concerts cancelled from March through May.¬¨‚Ä†  3. Funds will be distributed in proportion to the income loss as proven by paperwork described in the following section with a $5,000 cap. If enough funds are raised then all performers will be compensated fully.  4. All distribution records will be kept with transparency in mind.  5. Any extra fund beyond an artist's need will be refunded to donors.    To receive funds:¬¨‚Ä†    1. Be a performer in the Philadelphia/NYC/New Jersey area that relies on freelance work as a major source of income.¬¨‚Ä†  2. Be able to provide documentation of a show cancelled due to Covid-19 along with expected income and related cancellation fees, if applicable.   NOTE: This fundraiser will not benefit the organizers of this fundraiser in any way whatsoever. All proceeds will go to the performers.¬¨‚Ä†",

            "description": "Flight with us! Pray with us! I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m such an ordinary person quiet on social, I never thought I would be so desperate and devastated to draft a letter for help with face covering in tears! This January with the  outbreak of Coronavirus  at Wuhan my hometown‚Äö√π¬ß, I realized and is experiencing such a life-threatening moment for my family who are infected with the virus and hundreds of thousands of people are suffering this novel virus with pneumonia and hard to breath problem (China‚Äö√Ñ√¥s number is less than what‚Äö√Ñ√¥s real). They are on the fringe of fighting the virus through their own Immune Systems and Antivirus/antibacterial medicines with the city under quarantine, but the  sad thing is they lack medical supplies of masks, goggles, protection suits  to prevent the virus  from transmission to more people at the hospitals and communities at Wuhan  (even they also lack medicines, since those are prescription drugs there is no way we can purchase). Even though lots of people are trying to help in this matter including myself and my husband, there still lots of things we need to do and lots of supplies we need to send to China. As you may know Alibaba, Taobao those big online stores in China is sold out of masks, goggles, we are purchasing  supplies here at US to send back to China . Since its two of us on our part, we realized its wiser and better if we can collect help from the humanitarian society to help accelerate the process. If you are there and willing to help this effort, any dollar or connection with those supplies is welcomed! I attached all those first-hand information and the real moments of my friends circle on Wechat (a Chinese chat tool) to show you what‚Äö√Ñ√¥s really going on. And with all the dollars raised I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll  buy those supplies  and reply this crowdfunding with the  purchasing sheets and shipping information  to show how your money goes. Please also  send prayers  for Wuhan, I believe God can hear us! It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s near the time to re-examine ourselves and the world around us. 1.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† Who I am: Xinyu born at Wuhan, have been living at US since 2012 Fall came here for Graduate degree  2.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† Where I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m from: Wuchang District, Wuhan City, China  3.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† Relationship with parties raising funds: Family friends community hospitals in Wuhan. My father is hospitalized at Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, my grandpa is at Wuhan Tianyou Hospital. My mom and grandma currently don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have any spots available at the Hospital.  4.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† The Fund spent: will all be used for purchasing supplies like masks, goggles, protection suit and ship back to Wuhan.",

            "description": "Die Covid19-Pandemie hat auch uns vom  THEATER DER KL‚àö√ëNGE ¬¨‚Ä† getroffen. Mitten in der Probenphase f‚àö¬∫r unsere neue Produktion m‚àö¬∫ssen wir unseren Betrieb einstellen, weil das Risiko f‚àö¬∫r unser Ensemble, sich gegenseitig zu infizieren, einfach zu gro‚àö√º ist. Trotzdem haben all unsere T‚àö¬ßnzer, Video- und Tonk‚àö¬∫nstler aber auch unser Regisseur und unsere Choreographin Vertr‚àö¬ßge, die ihnen Lohn versprechen. Und das zurecht! Unsere K‚àö¬∫nstler sind n‚àö¬ßmlich oft freie Mitarbeiter, die nur von Engagement zu Engagement bezahlt werden und jetzt besonders stark getroffen werden. Daher rei‚àö√ºt uns unser Probenausfall momentan ein Loch von ca. 5.000 ‚Äö√á¬® in unsere Kalkulation.  Als freies Theater sind wir sehr von ‚àö‚àÇffentlicher F‚àö‚àÇrderung abh‚àö¬ßngig. In ‚àö¬∫ber 32 Jahren, die wir jetzt bestehen, sind wir von verschiedenen Institutionen regelm‚àö¬ß‚àö√ºig gro‚àö√ºz‚àö¬∫gig f‚àö¬∫r unsere einzigartige k‚àö¬∫nstlerische Arbeit gef‚àö‚àÇrdert worden. Doch die aktuelle Lage konnte niemand vorhersehen und auch nicht einkalkulieren.   Doch wir geben nicht auf!   Wir k‚àö‚àÇnnten jetzt einfach warten und versuchen, uns etwas von den staatlichen Notfallfonds zu sichern, die in Aussicht gestellt wurden, doch wir wollen aus dieser Situation lieber etwas gutes machen: Wir haben uns dazu entschlossen, solange der Lockdown weiter anh‚àö¬ßlt, w‚àö‚àÇchentlich einen unser Vorstellungsmittschnitte unser bislang 27 Produktionen online f‚àö¬∫r ein Wochenende zu ver‚àö‚àÇffentlichen.  Jeden Donnerstag Abend um 19:00 Uhr ver‚àö‚àÇffentlichen wir auf unserer Homepage eines unserer St‚àö¬∫cke in chronologischer Reihenfolge. Diese St‚àö¬∫cke sind zum Teil seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr gespielt worden und die dazugeh‚àö‚àÇrigen professionell gemachten Filme lagern seitdem in unserem Archiv.¬¨‚Ä†       Sie wollen Kultur und k‚àö‚àÇnnen diese momentan nicht erreichen?  Wir verstehen die aktuelle Lage gut und sehen mit Bedauern, dass Kultur das Erste war, was man gestrichen hat. Aber wenn Sie bislang gerne in Theater- oder Tanzvorstellungen gegangen sind, dann werden wir Sie begeistern!  Auf unserer Website  haben wir ausf‚àö¬∫hrliche Informationen zu all unseren bisherigen Produktionen ver‚àö‚àÇffentlicht, damit Sie sich einen Eindruck machen k‚àö‚àÇnnen, was wir bislang geschaffen haben. Die St‚àö¬∫cke im einzelnen sind:  1.  Die mechanische Bauhausb‚àö¬∫hne ¬¨‚Ä† (1987) 2.  Die barocke Maskenb‚àö¬∫hne ¬¨‚Ä† (1988/89) 3.  Die K‚àö¬∫che ¬¨‚Ä† nach Arnold Wesker (1990) 4.  November 1918 * 1989 ¬¨‚Ä† (1991) 5.  Figur uns Klang im Raum ¬¨‚Ä† (1993) 6.  Reden ist Silber... ¬¨‚Ä† (1994) 7.  Ludus Danielis ¬¨‚Ä† (1994)¬¨‚Ä† 8.  Die V‚àö‚àÇgel ¬¨‚Ä† nach Aristophanes (1996) 9.  Jubil‚àö¬ßum ¬¨‚Ä† (1997) 10.  Die Neuberin  (1999)  11.  Das Opfer  nach Igor Strawinsky (1999) 12.  Megalopolis ¬¨‚Ä†(2001) 13.  Modul|a|t|o|r ¬¨‚Ä†(2002) 14.  Gregorius auf dem Stein  nach Hartmann von Aue und Thomas Mann (2004) 15.  HOEReographien  (2005) 16.  Teufels Kreise  (2006) 17.  Ich ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ ist ein anderer ¬¨‚Ä† (2007) 18.  Johnnys Jihad ¬¨‚Ä† von Marc Pommerening (2009) 19.  Suite Intermediale ¬¨‚Ä† (2011) 20.  Vanitas ¬¨‚Ä† (2012)  21.

Das Lackballett  nach Oskar Schlemmer (2019)       Warum Spenden?  Zugegeben, wenn wir die Filme doch eh jede Woche hochladen, wo liegt da f‚àö¬∫r Sie der Anreiz zu spenden? Nun, der liegt in zwei Aspekten. Zum Einen helfen Sie uns wirklich weiter, denn wir k‚àö‚àÇnnen die Spenden im Moment gut gebrauchen! Als eingetragener Verein k‚àö‚àÇnnen wir Ihnen auch gerne eine Spendenquittung ausstellen. Zum Anderen haben wir uns noch ein kleines Dankesch‚àö‚àÇn ‚àö¬∫berlegt: f‚àö¬∫r jede Spende  ‚àö¬∫ber 50 ‚Äö√á¬®  geben wir Ihnen vorab den Vimeo-Link zu einem in dieser Woche nicht ver‚àö‚àÇffentlichten Mitschnitt. Sie k‚àö‚àÇnnen sich dann gerne so oft Sie wollen eine unserer 27 Produktionen ansehen und zwar vollkommen losgel‚àö‚àÇst von unserem Online-Premieren-Zeitplan.  Sie k‚àö‚àÇnnen also auch w‚àö¬ßhrend des Lockdowns virtuelles Theater von zuhause genie‚àö√ºen!   Organisatorisches  Als freies Theater leben wir von Zuschauern, die unsere Vorstellungen sehen kommen. Daher behalten wir uns vor, die Aktion mit den kostenfreien Filmen zu beenden, wenn sich die Lage entspannt und ein normaler Kulturbetrieb wieder m‚àö‚àÇglich ist. Auch im Falle, dass die Aktion auf kein Interesse st‚àö‚àÇ‚àö√ºt, behalten wir uns vor, sie fr‚àö¬∫hzeitig zu beenden. Im Fall von Problemen mit der ‚àö√∫bermittlung von eMail-Adressen zum Erhalt von Vimeo-Links, nehmen Sie bitte ‚àö¬∫ber das Kontaktformular Kontakt mit uns auf. Wir werden uns dann versuchen, so schnell wie m‚àö‚àÇglich darum zu k‚àö¬∫mmern. Auch bei weiteren Fragen stehen wir gerne ‚àö¬∫ber das Kontaktformular zur Verf‚àö¬∫gung.",

            "description": " **ENGLISH BELOW**  Beste klanten/ thuisblijvers/ bak-enthousiasten,  Het zijn moeilijke tijden voor ons allemaal. Elke dag verandert de situatie om het uur en het is soms moeilijk te volgen wat wel en niet meer mag. Onze dagelijkse routines zijn verstoord en het voelt surrealistisch. Helaas zijn er mensen die deze periode alleen doorbrengen, of mensen die niet weten wat morgen hen zal brengen. Veel plaatsen hebben steun en hulp nodig door de vele gesloten zaken en diensten. De verpleegkundigen en artsen werken de klok rond om deze bittere situatie beter te maken. Kinderopvang centra en creches zijn de juiste oplossingen aan het zoeken om de gesloten scholen en activiteiten goed te maken voor onze kleinsten en door de sluiting van alle cafes en vrijetijds plaatsen, lijken de straten volledig leeg.  Hoewel Jerome open mag blijven, mbt de maatregelen die sinds 18/03 gelden, willen wij nog een groter bijdrage leveren aan het ‚Äö√Ñ√∫terug gezond maken‚Äö√Ñ√π van onze maatschappij!   Daarmee komen wij met de volgende voorstel:  Wij hebben een GoFundMe ogestart om SOS Kinderdorpen Belgie en de gezondheidszorgsector te steunen in deze tijden. Doordat er geen school, stages of kampen doorgaan heeft SOS Kinderdorpen nood aan nieuwe meters en peters zodat de kinderen de komende weken in betere omstandigheden hun dagen doorbrengen. Verder is het geen geheim dat er een tekort aan materiaal is om onze geneeskundigen te beschermen in de ziekenhuizen.   Bij iedere gift dat jullie schenken wordt een authentiek recept priv‚àö¬© naar jullie gestuurd van onze heerlijke pannenkoeken. Op deze manier kunnen jullie een stukje Jerome in huis brengen. Bak met jullie kinderen, roep uw broer of zus erbij, maak er vooral een familie-moment van. Al het geld dat ingezameld wordt zal 50 : 50 verdeeld worden tussen SOS Kinderdorpen en een ziekenhuis in Vlaanderen . Dus kruip achter het fornuis, zamel in en help ons de virus tegen te gaan!  Nu, meer dan ooit, moeten wij doorbijten en samenspannen om zo snel mogelijk een vorm van controle te cre‚àö¬¥ren.  ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† +++ BELANGRIJK +++  Stuur ons een screenshot van jullie gift via prive bericht op Instagram of Facebook, en wij sturen jullie ons recepture door.   ********************************************************************* Dear customers/ stay-at-home-ers/ baking-enthusiast,  These are strange times for everyone. Everyday there is a change in the situation, with updates appearing by the hour, and it can be quite difficult to follow what we can and cannot do anymore. Our daily routines have been interrupted and it feels surreal. Unfortunately there are people who go through this all alone, or people who don't know what tomorrow will bring. A lot of places need support and aid now that a lot of services have been shut down. The nurses and doctors work around the clock to better this bitter situation. Daycare centres are searching for the right solutions to keep our little ones busy now that schools and after-school-activities have been shut down. And because of the closed bars and cafes, the cities and streets seem completely empty.¬¨‚Ä†  Although we, at Cremerie Jerome, are fortunate to stay open and offer take-away (following the rules given on 18/3), we are still looking for ways to do more to make the community healthy and prosperous again.¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä†  That is why we are proposing the following:  With this GoFundMe we are looking to support SOS Kinderdorpen Belgium and the health sector in these trying times. Due to the schools, internships and camps shutting down, SOS Kinderdorpen is in need of \"\"godparents\"\" to financially aid the kids the coming weeks. Furthermore, it is no secret that the shortage of medical masks and -materials, in general, prove to be an issue in the protection of our medicinal staff.  When a donation is given, we will send our authentic pancake recipe to you in private. That way, you can bring a part of Jerome into your homes. Bake with your children, invite your brother and/or sister to join you, above all make it a family gathering!   All of the collected money will be divided 50:50 between SOS Kinderdorpen and a hospital in Flanders. So, what are you waiting for? Place yourself behind your stove, donate and help us fight the virus!  Now, more than ever, is the time for us to work together and bite through!!  ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† +++ IMPORTANT +++   Send us a screenshot of your donation in private chat (on Instagram or Facebook) and we will send you our recipe.¬¨‚Ä† ",

            "description": "¬¨‚Ä†This is a wonderful family that we have known for many years, also one of their sweet girls is our son Coltons ¬¨‚Ä†girlfriend Becca's daddy has recently come into contact with the corona virus. He is not doing well at all, and they have finally admitted him to the the hospital, after another local hospital kept sending him home. ¬¨‚Ä†They have been quarantined and they haven‚Äö√Ñ√¥t been able to get out like most of us to get groceries. Josh has also missed work because of the quarantine. They have seven wonderful kids, who are starting to get hungry, but they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re trying to keep all of us healthy by staying quarantined. You can imagine what a nightmare this would be.  ¬¨‚Ä†I have Instacart and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m trying to get a few donations to help me send them the groceries they need to get through this quarantined. Anything will help!! If you can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t donate please say a prayer for Papa!! He is one of the kindest men I have ever met and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s killing them that they can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be with him. Some of the kids have also had some of the symptoms, please pray for a total healing for this family. I have Becca's permission to make this Gofundme and I also have her permission to share a scary video of Papa struggling to breathe. ¬¨‚Ä†Please pray for this family and put them on you prayer lists at church",

            "description": "In 2018 I ran the Pittsburgh Marathon and achieved my dream of qualifying for the Boston Marathon.  I missed the cut-off by 90 seconds that year.  In 2019 I ran the Pittsburgh marathon to re-qualify for the Boston Marathon and made the cut to run Boston in 2020.     Due to COVID-19, Boston 2020 won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be held on April 20, 2020.     As someone who studies immunology and infectious diseases, I have come to realize that there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s more to COVID-19 than just the symptoms and mortality rate. COVID-19 has incited fear and uncertainty for people across the globe, not just for the demographics that are most affected medically. The economic repercussions will impact those who are paid hourly and those without the benefit of sick leave.     So, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve decided to make my own ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Not-Boston Marathon‚Äö√Ñ√π and run 26.2 miles on April 20, 2020. I want this to mean something more than just a race.      I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m running to raise money for the Jean B. Purvis Community Health Clinic which is a free medical clinic that provides services for people who fall below the poverty line/are uninsured or underinsured in my hometown. This clinic is almost fully operated on a volunteer basis along with community donations. With many people unable to work due to COVID-19, individuals who rely on this clinic may feel the strain more than most.     I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t change the course of a global pandemic, but I can control my reaction to it. In times like this, the silver lining is important.     If you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re still reading this, thank you. Any donations or words of encouragement are appreciated.

            "description": "As most of you know I recently moved to Vietnam to start a new chapter of my life. ¬¨‚Ä†Once my father passed away I knew even more-so that this change was needed in my life.  It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s something I was so desperate to do not only to change my life for the better, ¬¨‚Ä†but to make myself and my family proud. Each day I wake up thankful tobe here, thankful that I went through with this dream and continue to make my dad proud.¬¨‚Ä†  Since the CoronaVirus decided to appear, not only has the world come to a stop still but also my mind and mental health as abruptly come crashing down. So much so I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve contemplating giving up this dream completely, so much so that Im sleep depriving myself, so much so that anxiety and panic attacks have become second nature. Then I think about leaving again, something I know will make me feel like an even bigger failure. During this outbreak it has left me uncertain of how I might continue to not only have a roof over my head, ¬¨‚Ä†but cover basic needs such as food and water. The virus has stopped all schools from opening, which in turn means us teachers are left with nothing. As it stands the schools are not due to open any time soon which does mean basic living necessities will be something I no longer have access to. Food and water will no longer be a viable option, let alone having somewhere to live.¬¨‚Ä†   All I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m asking for is help, in any way shape or form. Every penny counts, and I will use whatever funds are raised to cover living expenses as well as manage to feed and water myself. Any further funds that I manage to raise will goto a charity that helps individuals in crisis situations. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t expect anyone to donate however if you choose to, just know that i am beyond grateful. I will forever be truly thankful ‚Äö√¥‚Ä¢√î‚àè√®",

            "description": "This fund is being established as a partnership with Day One Disaster Relief and supported by community leaders: Mayor Steve Schewel;¬¨‚Ä† City Council Members: Vernetta Alston, Javiera Caballero, DeDreana Freeman, Jillian Johnson, Mark-Anthony Middleton, and Charlie Reece; and members of The Durham County Board of Commissioners.  Additional local and state partnerships are currently being developed.¬¨‚Ä†  As with other campaigns that I have organized for our community in Durham, I ask that you trust that the funds will be distributed to the most critical need, in the most equitable way possible. I've shown this commitment through previous campaigns including helping to pay down Durham's Lunch Debt, assisting Durham community member's impacted by the explosion last April through Bull City Rebuilds, as a member of the Durham One Fund task force, and most recently in support of residents at McDougald Terrace.¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†  As an example, the funds will be used to:¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†- support individuals whose livelihood was impacted by the outbreak ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†- purchase medical supplies ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†- purchase cleaning supplies ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†- provide community support for those who are most vulnerable¬¨‚Ä†  **Aid will be distributed to communities who currently have confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses.**¬¨‚Ä†  Any funds raised beyond what is needed help impacted communities will be reserved for future community disaster relief in Durham and North Carolina.¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä† About DAY ONE: Through strong community relationships, Day One Disaster Relief serves disaster-impacted populations. Since each disaster is unique, a disaster relief solution that is predictable, repeatable and systematic in nature has been identified as what's needed to make an improved impact.  Day One Disaster Relief was founded during Hurricane Florence to rapidly source and deliver supplies (via air and road) to those affected by the hurricane. We formed as a result of our efforts spearheading the rapid response at the TAC AIR terminal at RDU in September 2018.   We brought together volunteer pilots and NGO‚Äö√Ñ√¥s who have been on the ground in eastern NC, some for 45+ years. We raised the supply chain and engaged the community which resulted in 1500 volunteers throughout the week at RDU. We have continued our work serving the survivors of Hurricanes Michael and Dorian as well as supporting residents evacuated from McDougald Terrace public housing neighborhood in Durham, NC.  Through our experience at RDU, we identified the need to create a decentralized collaborative based disaster relief organization to facilitate volunteer, NGO, donor, and government coordination during a rapid disaster response specifically focusing on communities that are often forgotten during large disasters. (i.e. farmworkers and migrant laborers, poor, frontline, people of color, and under-resourced communities)   Our structure allows us to effectively and efficiently work with smaller NGOs who often become distribution hubs and community support organizations in the wake of a disaster. We have a network of trusted relationships across our state which is ever-expanding. These NGOS are the people who have deep relationships with their communities and people who start disasters at net zero. Day One Disaster Relief partners with these organizations to provide rapid response aid and long term relief.",

Just days before his birthday on January 18, 2018 he became gravely ill and was absent from school. Shortly after his birthday, his physician sent Jacob to Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago for further testing and it was discovered that he had cancer in his blood. The diagnosis was Childhood Leukemia. This was devastating to hear for Ms. Corona, Jacob's mom, as she is a single parent. Originally from Mexico, Ms. Corona came to this country to seek a better life. She has a wonderful son who she considers a blessing. She is naturally distraught at the prospect of having to take a leave of absence from work to provide round the clock care for Jacob. Her employer issued insurance will run out when the sick leave ends as the treatment for Jacob will take three (3) years. Ms. Corona is fearful that not having any income at the moment she will not be able to pay her rent and bills. Any donations you are able to contribute will be greatly appreciated. These donations will help her manage the expense of driving into downtown Chicago for his weekly treatments, purchase the medical supplies and prescription medicines that he needs, and make it possible for Ms. Corona to purchase groceries to keep up with the dietary needs of her son. Thank you for your prayers and donations. The road to recovery is long and the aggressive chemotherapy and blood transfusions are going to take their toll on little Jacob. But with your prayers and support, we hope to make it a little easier for the Corona Family to deal with the financial hardship they are beginning to endure. *******************JULY 16 2019 JACOB HAS RELAPSED AND WE ARE STARTING HIS FUNDRAISING EFFORTS ALL OVER. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO WAY TO RESET THE AMOUNT TO ZERO SO IT IS STILL SHOWING THE $5,400 WE THANKFULLY RAISED FOR THE FAMILY WITH HIS FIRST BATTLE BUT AS WE KNOW THE LIVING EXPENSES, PARKING EXPENSES, ETC. ENDURED THE 1ST TIME AROUND USED UP THE ENTIRE AMOUNT RAISED. WE DO APPRECIATE ANY AND ALL DONATIONS WE CAN RAISE FOR THIS SECOND BATTLE THE CORONA FAMILY IS ABOUT TO ENDURE. JACOB'S mom had to once again quit her Job after just returning a few months ago when he went into remission, however a few months back when Mrs.Corona was told he was in remission and his treatments would be less frequent and she got the OK to put him in Daycare she did and quickly returned to work! She is a very hardworking mom but unfortunately now that he has relapsed and is having weekly chemotherapy and weekly bloodwork and this is just the beginning of another much more aggressive treatment her priority is being at Jacob's side, so she had to resign from her job. The Unity In Community is supporting a fundraiser hosted by The American Legion for Jacob on 8/30/2019, you can find more information on his FB page and you can check for future event or other future fundraisers, it's Jacob Strong - Jacob Corona. We are extremely grateful to everyone for past and future donations! He is scheduled for his 3rd Chemotherapy treatment for the relapse on 8/19/2019.Update March 2020Jacob has continued with Chemotherapy, since the relapse he's done 3 different chemotherapies each bonemarrow biopsy shows they've helped but bot enough to where he qualifies for a bonemarrow transplant. The best and only option at this time is getting Stem cells from his original donor in Hope's to bring the cancer percentage down enough to qualify him for a transplant or wipe it out completely. Jacob is currently scheduled to start a 6 days chemotherapy treatment on March 11th to prepare him to receive the cells that his very amazing donor has agreed to give him. He is due to get the cells on March 17th. This is will be tough on Jacob but he is a resilient child and very strong we have faith that he will be ok.",

            "description": "GARMENT DISTRICT FOR GOWNS - COVID-19 SUPPORT FUND   COVID-19 has now afflicted more people in the United States than in any other country in the world. Each day, more people become infected and our hospitals face new challenges handling mounting patient inflows. New York has become the epicenter of the pandemic, with Governor Cuomo predicting the apex of hospitalizations to occur in 2-3 weeks‚Äö√Ñ√¥ time.  Healthcare workers worldwide are taking enormous risks on behalf of us all. In Italy, this segment represents more than 10% of Coronavirus cases, given its proximity to sick patients. And it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s become a well-known fact that Italy‚Äö√Ñ√¥s healthcare system has more hospital beds per 1,000 people than the United States, putting pressure on an already strained healthcare system.  New York City hospitals are already in dire need of more Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to protect their staff and mitigate further spread of the disease. They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re especially hurting for masks and gowns.  Fortunately, we can help - but we must act now.   To accelerate this effort, we have launched the COVID-19 Support Fund to help finance and scale the manufacturing of medical gowns, beginning with healthcare workers in New York City.   WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE THESE ITEMS IN NEED    Who are we?   We are a group of independent professionals in the fashion industry, with training and experience working for brands such as Ralph Lauren, Dior, Marchesa, The Row, Vera Wang, Ralph Rucci, and Oscar de la Renta. We are designers, product developers, pattern makers, and sewers, and we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re strengthened by our relationships with factories in New York City‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Garment District.¬¨‚Ä†  We have assembled our skills and resources to help supply healthcare workers with an essential piece of protection needed on the front lines. We have already self-financed our first batch of 300 gowns and have alerted Governor Cuomo‚Äö√Ñ√¥s office and Tri-State area hospitals to coordinate on distribution.  We need your help to continue making more gowns and scale fast.    First milestone:  The first batch of gowns will be delivered to Mount Sinai   Jersey City Hospital by April 2nd.   WHY GOWNS?¬¨‚Ä†   Our team is already able to source the appropriate fabrics needed to make medical gowns that meet the rigorous standards of the healthcare community. Unlike face masks, which require FDA-approved filters that are harder to come by in this moment of crisis, medical gowns are made of high performance fabrics, which we are versed in handling and feel confident we can produce in batch quantities. However, sufficient funding is needed to maintain our output.    Pictured above:  Nurses at Mount Sinai West wear trash bags when left with no better alternative for protective gear, according to the  NY Post ¬¨‚Ä†.¬¨‚Ä†   WHY NOW?   On March 27th, Gov. Cuomo laid out the state‚Äö√Ñ√¥s current medical supply stockpile, against anticipated quantities needed ahead of the virus‚Äö√Ñ√¥ peak (see Figure 1). NY state currently has 15,000 gowns on hand, with another 145,000 expected from the federal government.  The state needs a total of 20 million gowns in three weeks to adequately protect healthcare workers from the virus.      Figure 1:  Slide depiction of Gov. Cuomo‚Äö√Ñ√¥s statewide equipment needs, reported by  Syracuse.com ¬¨‚Ä†.   ABOUT OUR GOWNS    The main fabric  is an extra strength DWR coated (Durable Water Repellent) ripstop nylon, with a breathable polyurethane coating.¬¨‚Ä† It was originally manufactured for military use in the Afghan War.   The cuffs  are made of organic cotton jersey knit (eco friendly OEKO-TEX), and ensure a secure and sealed fit at the wrist.   The pattern  is worn with an opening in the back, like standard medical gowns. Medical workers put them on arms-first, then tie around the waist and back of the neck. Waist ties are long enough to tie in the back or front, aiding in quick application and removal. (See early-stage prototype in Figure 2)   The sewers  are volunteers from our own professional networks, as well as other incredible individuals who saw the announcements we put out and stepped up. Each one of our sewers receives their cutwork in a premade kit, which includes :¬¨‚Ä†   Cutwork for x-amount of gowns   Thread   Latex gloves to use while sewing the gowns, and instructions to wear a mask as they sew   Instructions to clean their station with bleach before and after they sew   An extra bag to return their finished gowns in   The logistics :   Rolls of our fabric are transferred from supplier to driver, both wearing masks and gloves.   Cutting room is sterilized and all pattern work is performed with masks and gloves   Cutwork and sewing/ safety supplies are sprayed with disinfectant before being bagged, while wearing masks and gloves.   A member of our team delivers the bag to the sewer without physical contact   Sewer disinfects workspaces with bleach prior to sewing, and wears a mask and gloves while working.¬¨‚Ä†   Should sewer step away from the project midway, they are instructed to place the garment in its respective bag until returning. Sewing area will then be re-sterilized.   Once the gown is complete, sewer puts finished product in a new bag that a member of our team will pick up, maintaining six feet of separation from one another.   The cost:  It currently costs us an average of $5.50 per gown. This includes materials, trucking for fabric delivery, cutting room costs, and latex gloves we supply in our sewing kits for volunteer sewers.     Figure 2 : See above pictures of an early-stage prototype of our gown in a sub-fabric.   WHO WE ARE    Rachel Rothenberg-Saenz  is a graduate of Parsons School of Design who most recently works as Head of Product Design   Development for Oscar de la Renta. Previously, she has worked in both design and development capacities at Ralph Lauren, The Row, and Ralph Rucci.¬¨‚Ä†   Alex Baylis  is a graduate of Central Saint Martins University in London, who most recently works as Senior Knitwear Designer for Oscar de la Renta.

OUR COMMITMENT   We will be posting stories   photos of our donations, hospitals and healthcare workers you are helping on our Instagram @ garmentdistrictforgowns ¬¨‚Ä†   OUR ACHIEVEMENTS IN A NUTSHELL¬¨‚Ä†     Secured fabric   Secured factories in the Garment District ready to help   Secured a team of 30+ volunteer sewers   Built contacts with hospitals and state representatives to securely guide donations   Began production of 300 gowns to be donated by April 2nd   OUR FUNDING    100% of the funds  will go directly to financing the production of our gowns and other urgent PPE for frontline healthcare workers at New York City‚Äö√Ñ√¥s largest hospitals. No one on the team will benefit financially in any way from this campaign.¬¨‚Ä† We are committed to ensuring that our suppliers provide us with the most competitive rates available for medical-grade gowns, so that the value of each dollar we raise is maximized. Should we raise excess funds and supplies, we hope to expand our donations to other hospitals in need.    FAQs    Are donations tax deductible?¬¨‚Ä†   Currently, donations are not tax-deductible. We are in a process of filing a 501(c)(3) charity and will update our status as soon as possible.    Aside from donations, how can you help?¬¨‚Ä†   We are seeking:   Garment District volunteer factories   Experienced volunteer sewers   Thread donations (sewing supply stores are currently closed as they are ‚Äö√Ñ√∫non-essential,‚Äö√Ñ√π and thread online orders do not arrive quickly enough).   What‚Äö√Ñ√¥s next?   NY has been hit the hardest and first within the United States, however statistics show that COVID-19 will soon affect the rest of the country in a similar fashion. While we are taking care of our own state first (as the need is most dire right here, right now), we plan to expand our efforts nationwide as funding and supplies allow.

Furthermore, it is even more hurtful seeing our national healthcare system not being able to cope with such an emergency. In some areas of the peninsula, doctors talk about 'a war scenery', having to arbitrarily decide who lives and who dies due to the lack of space in hospitals.¬¨‚Ä†  Hence, our will to do something, even if little, to try to help our country.¬¨‚Ä†  Despite the fact that we no longer live in Italy,¬¨‚Ä† us, members of REGIB - Rete dei Giovani Italiani in Belgio (Network of Young Italians in Belgium), would like to unite and support the areas most affected by the COVID-19.¬¨‚Ä†  All funds collected will be donated to the ITALIAN RED CROSS - CROCE ROSSA ITALIANA (CRI).¬¨‚Ä†  The Italian Red Cross is the Italian national branch of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. CRI has been truly helpful and active on the full national territory since the first outbreak of the disease. The personnel and the volunteers are tirelessly supporting crucial activities in the fight against this pandemic, from first aid care to screening, from logistics to service aid.  For this reason, we ask to all our friends to help us fund-raise and spread the word about this important initiative.¬¨‚Ä†  Every cent can truly make a difference, and help the healthcare personnel as well as the affected ones.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†  Help us by giving what you can: united we stand strong and we can win this fight!!  * The Young Italians Network in Belgium ¬¨‚Ä†is an association which aims to support both incoming young Italians and young Italians already living in Belgium, through the creation of a social and professional network.  The association aims to become a landmark for young Italians arriving and living in Belgium, but also for those going back to Italy. We are committed to creating a forum for young Italians, as well as strengthening national ties, through interactions with the most important Italian and European players in Belgium and in Europe, with the aim to promote Italian culture amongst youth in Belgium.   ________________________________________________  FRANCAIS :  Pour des Jeunes Italiens r‚àö¬©sidents ‚àö‚Ä† l‚Äö√Ñ√¥‚àö¬©tranger, c‚Äö√Ñ√¥est vraiment d‚àö¬©chirant de voir le pays dans lequel nous sommes n‚àö¬©s et avons grandi r‚àö¬©duit ‚àö‚Ä† une grande zone rouge. ‚àö√§tre loin de la maison et ne pas pouvoir ‚àö‚Ñ¢tre pr‚àö¬Æs des n‚àö¬•tres nous fait sentir impuissants face ‚àö‚Ä† cette trag‚àö¬©die que l‚Äö√Ñ√¥Italie tout enti‚àö¬Ære est en train d‚Äö√Ñ√¥affronter.

Our business has closed temporarily¬¨‚Ä†in order to keep staff and customers safe during the COVID-19/Novel Coronavirus outbreak.  As a company that cares about the well-being of our employees, we are doing everything we can to cushion the blow that we know this temporary closing will have. Our staff will be able to draw down on their paid time off immediately if they choose to do so. Beyond that, each staff member will receive a furlough bonus of $500 to help cover expenses before unemployment insurance begins to be paid out.¬¨‚Ä† In addition, the company will continue to provide health, dental, vision, and short-term disability insurance while staff are on furlough and we will pay for 100% of the premium costs.  Unfortunately, we know that this is not going to be enough to avoid major disruptions to their lives and it does not appear that we can count on the federal government for assistance right now.¬¨‚Ä† Furthermore, as the length of our shutdown increases, our ability to continue to assist staff will be impaired due to a lack of revenue and depletion of business savings.¬¨‚Ä†  As a result, we are trying to raise $50,000.¬¨‚Ä† It's enough to cover a bit more than $3,000 per employee, which will help them make do until the country returns to normal. These funds will be split evenly and paid out directly to our furloughed workers.¬¨‚Ä†  We know that you and your family are likely struggling during this difficult time as well.¬¨‚Ä† Thank you for whatever support you can provide.",

We never thought phrase ‚Äö√Ñ√∫ Starving Artists‚Äö√Ñ√π will come true in our lives but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s here and we must accept it. Trust us , we would never want to show our puffy eyes all over internet if we didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need help, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not easy but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s necessary at this moment in our lives. We are faced to ask our community for help. We believe in the power of communities especially in the global crisis like this. We All are One! Many of you know we are artists living in Atlanta , GA and our favorite/main way to share our art is through local/national arts/crafts festivals, music, yoga events , local farmers markets etc so we can interact with our customers in person exchanging smiles, sharing our gifts and positive vibe through all the communities. Like you All know due to Corona Virus global crisis All the events/festivals/gatherings/shops/restaurants have been canceled , closed, postponed at least for next two months (who knows what will happen after that) which is so understandable because Health is the most important thing and we are aware it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s important to follow the guidance in order not to spread the virus. Social distancing as much as possible is a must at this moment. Our hearts goes out to our fellow artists and All the people impacted by this global crisis. We created Go Fund Me in hopes of people who are ABLE to contribute and help us through this unexpected crisis so we can stay strong, healthy and creative. We will be grateful for any generosity you can share, every penny counts. These funds will help us with ¬¨‚Ä†paying rent, utilities, car payments, credit card bills, ¬¨‚Ä†phone, internet bills , medical bills, food for us and our furry friends, art supplies so we are still be able to continue making our product for future events/festivals/stores ,you know, all the necessary things to survive through this crisis. ( We understand some of the companies might work with us through this but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s unknown/uncertain ¬¨‚Ä†so far since ¬¨‚Ä†everyone is impacted by this)¬¨‚Ä†  If you would like to support us through our product we offer free shipping on our online shop   https://vallets.com  ¬¨‚Ä†or our Etsy Shop ¬¨‚Ä†  https://www.etsy.com/shop/IngaAndEvija  ¬¨‚Ä† add coupon code FREESHIPPING at the check out and you all are set:) PS. Also since we will have more time on our hands for some time , we are willing to donate our time if anyone needs any help, please let us know.  Please share !  With Love Inga And Puffy Eyes",

Some examples are:    https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/16/uk-theatre-coronavirus-cancellations   - GIGAID - Set up by Bryony Kimmings, this fund is matching artists with funding during this unprecedented time.    https://www.artsminds.co.uk/   - ARTSMINDS - an organisation that do¬¨‚Ä† incredible work proving mental health support in the arts.¬¨‚Ä†    https://alpmusicals.com/donate   - AMPLIFY - a fund that works closely with artists in theatre on new work, providing nurturing experiences  and facilitating opportunities for creators of all ages.¬¨‚Ä†  My website is  www.jordanclarkemusic.co.uk   I live and work in London, and can guarantee you something awesome and creative will come from your donation. I've worked in live creative¬¨‚Ä† events for my whole career, and have called upon the help of the charities above, or worked closely with them on projects of my own. I know first-hand what a difference a bit of support can make.  Can't wait to hear from you all!  Spread love at this crazy time.  Jordan ",

Pharmacies will be open with reduced hours. You can still go to the doctor, however¬¨‚Ä† you cannot enter waiting rooms of hospital emergency areas, senior citizens homes or hospice unless there are serious reasons.  ¬¨‚Ä†  People are only allowed to leave home to buy food or medicine, and only one member of the family can do so.  ¬¨‚Ä†  ANYONE who leaves home MUST carry an self-declaration document even if you are going to the store or pharmacy.  Gatherings of any kind are prohibited.¬¨‚Ä† You are not allowed to visit family or friends unless for serious reasons.¬¨‚Ä† Organizing dinners and parties inside your home is prohibited.  All Bars, restaurants, pubs, and bakeries are closed.¬¨‚Ä† All spas   salons are closed.  All church services are cancelled, to include baptisms, weddings, and funerals.  You can go for a run or park as long as you keep the safe distance.  Dogs can be walked only in the immediate vicinity of your residence.  No travel to holiday homes or vacation spots.  ¬¨‚Ä†  There is an eerie feeling in the streets as I walk my dog in our immediate vicinity‚Äö√Ñ¬∂¬¨‚Ä† the streets are empty with the exception of a few individuals on their way to the grocery store with there rolling shopping bags.  ¬¨‚Ä†  It is silent.¬¨‚Ä† In a way that is uncomfortable.¬¨‚Ä† Think of New York City being the city that never sleeps, and no one is outside.¬¨‚Ä† All work is shut down.¬¨‚Ä† And there is no noise, not even the sound of construction or car horns. ¬¨‚Ä†  Here in Italy, we are on the edge of a major economical crisis.¬¨‚Ä† Average salaries in Italy range from 1000-1400 Euros per month.¬¨‚Ä† That is similar to 1100 -1600 U.S.D.¬¨‚Ä†   ¬¨‚Ä†  Most people live paycheck to paycheck.  ¬¨‚Ä†  Many in Florence work in Tourism, which took the first hit.¬¨‚Ä† Followed by restaurants,¬¨‚Ä† and even down to hair salons and local bakeries.  ¬¨‚Ä†  There are many individuals I know that don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have enough money for groceries to even sustain them for the week, as they have already been out of work for 3-4¬¨‚Ä† weeks now.¬¨‚Ä† I have personally assisted individuals that I know by buying groceries and gifting them money to get their essentials.  ¬¨‚Ä†  Help me help those in need here in Italy!!!¬¨‚Ä†   ¬¨‚Ä†  Here‚Äö√Ñ√¥s what I am doing   Here is how YOU can Help me Help the Residents of Florence.  ¬¨‚Ä†  My mission and business,¬¨‚Ä† La Luce, (meaning ‚Äö√Ñ√∫the light‚Äö√Ñ√π in Italian) provides guidance, healing, and inspiration and helps individuals find the light among the darkness.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† As a Soul Revival Consultant, Life Coach, and Intuitive Healer, I will be donating a 50% of proceeds from La Luce from now until 15 April to those in need.¬¨‚Ä† Appointments can be booked directly at www.laluce.com.  ¬¨‚Ä†  In addition, I will be accepting donations through La Luce to go directly to local residents.

I am starting a \"\"GoFundMe\"\" page to help her during this time of need. My mother was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday, April 30th, 2019 after enduring bouts of severe abdominal pain and fever. Upon admission, they gathered lab work, she underwent a pelvic ultrasound, a CT scan, and further examinations. The physicians at Banner Hospital were able to identify a ruptured cyst on her left ovary, a tubo-ovarian abscess of her left fallopian tube and further infection that had spread to her organs. They tried multiple strong antibiotics and a drain to help the infection, this failed to improve her condition. On Wednesday, May 1st, momma underwent surgery and had her left fallopian tube, left ovary and appendix removed. As I write this on the 5th of May, my mother remains in critical condition. The doctors suspect the infection is widespread and she will most likely need additional surgery. I plead that you all help us in our time of need. My mother and father, the breadwinners, are currently not working due to the nature of my mother's situation. Me, their eldest daughter, I am currently recovering from a recent Rottweiler attack to the face and my youngest sister is currently recovering from right hip surgery. We have had quite a tough few weeks. We just need the support of our friends, family and our community to get through this. My mother does have medical insurance, unfortunately, she has quite a large deductible. If we can raise this money, we would be able to cover her medical expenses and their lost wages for this week. We hope she will recover soon and I will update the page to keep you all posted. Thank you in advance for all of your help. All donations matter and are greatly appreciated.    We are a strong family unit and we just want to get past this and be able to return to our lives as normal.¬¨‚Ä†  -Brenda Corona       ",

They are probably the most vulnerable people without access to food and supplies. I along with my fianc‚àö¬© will be buying hand sanitizer, tissue, paper towel, mask, other products and food using the donation to those in need especially homeless people. If I am unable to give everything, I will make sure to at least give out hand sanitizer and food.¬¨‚Ä† Instead of worrying and watching people panic over the shortage of toilet paper, I thought about creating a campaign to give to others. If you are unable to donate, sharing this fundraiser will be greatly appreciated.  I will also send pictures or updates ¬¨‚Ä†for proof once the goal has been met. ¬¨‚Ä†In addition, my fianc‚àö¬© and I will be donating blood.   Thank you all for your kindness and generosity. God bless.¬¨‚Ä† Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s help humanity one step at a time.   (Since the minimum donation is $5. If $5 is too much and you only want to send$1, contact me. ¬¨‚Ä†I will gladly refund your $4 using cash app. A valid proof must be needed first to make you that you are the donor and not a scam. Please give 3-6 business days.)",

Our mission is to use Chinese culture as a carrier to promote social progress and build a spiritual home for Chinese Americans. Our three focuses are based on love, inherit culture, and focusing. The first focus is love, which means we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll be organizing social events-such as fundraising, donation, teaching children living in hills--in order to spread the love to the community. The second is based on culture inheriting. As Chinese Americans, we also have projects and activities to promote Chinese culture and art. Thirdly, we will focus our spirit and mission, creating a welcoming and helpful environment/community for Chinese American students. In the future, we will be reaching out to different states and China to help plan trips, college applications, and internships.   On behalf of our Spark organization, our goal is to help Wuhan, China and we have the responsibility to help those who have been affected by this deadly virus, which is circulating all around the world. According to the New York Times, in Wuhan, there are already more than 14,000 people affected, and more than 300 have died from this severe virus. Not only in China, but the United States so far has shown 8 cases with one of which hits in the bay area. With the severity of this disease, we want to help by holding a Go-Fund-Me fundraiser to provide supplies for the affected people in Wuhan and their scarcity in medical supplies.

it destroyed my adrenal glands.¬¨‚Ä† In November 2016, I stopped taking the active folate.¬¨‚Ä† After two months, my body came off my \"\"active folate high\"\", revealing that my adrenal glands were destroyed.¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†Since January 2017, I have had debilitating and chronic fatigue.¬¨‚Ä† I cannot just take iron pills or energy drinks to recover.¬¨‚Ä† My fatigue is so bad that after typing about fifteen to thirty minutes, my wrists will become very painful from fatigue.¬¨‚Ä† I cannot do office work.¬¨‚Ä† I am even too tired to read most books that I find enjoyable.¬¨‚Ä† This is not laziness or a lack of will power, but a major physical disability.¬¨‚Ä† Sustainable and meaningful recover requires a long process of supplements and treatments arranged by the famous specialist in adrenal fatigue, Dr. Carrie Lam of Orange County, California. ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†My health is so bad that in the very likely case that I catch the coronavirus, I am almost certain to die from it even though I am 36 years old.¬¨‚Ä† This is because it affects mainly old people and those with pre-existing conditions - exactly like mine.¬¨‚Ä† Therefore, I am desperate to find a way to recover from the coronavirus, as well as to help my parents pay my medical bills for Dr. Lam.¬¨‚Ä† I could not accept money from strangers unless I had some pretty precise and well-thought out plans, which I am rapidly working to devise.¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†My current plan is to go out into a very sparsely populated rural area and either rent a small cabin/apartment for three months or to live in a tent if necessary in a state park.¬¨‚Ä† I will consult multiple doctors to see if this is a sound idea.¬¨‚Ä† I believe I could do this for as little as $2000-$3000.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† I would be as grateful as any man can be for somebody saving my life from certain death, which is basically what they would be doing as far as I am concerned.¬¨‚Ä† Right now, I depend on my parents for all my needs, but my parents, even though I love and respect them, are not competent or prudent.¬¨‚Ä† They will probably die from the virus too, but they are not taking it seriously.¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† I would try very hard to pay my donors back and if necessary, I could get on the dole so my private donors wouldn't have to pay for my food.¬¨‚Ä† I have never had an aptitude for planning, but I have a lot of talent and I am still idealistic enough that I am willing to undergo a lot of hardship.¬¨‚Ä† I have a strong belief in personal responsibility, but I was too idealistic, unrealistic, and lonely in college to have the sense to study on Sundays.¬¨‚Ä† I have some Presbyterian, Scotch-Irish blood in me and as a result, I am stubborn and self-reliant to a fault.¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†Now, though, I desperately need help to save my life.¬¨‚Ä† I am ashamed to ask for help, but I did refuse to get on the dole or on Social Security disability for 11 years.¬¨‚Ä† I could have been on the latter for five years with perfect justification, but I hate asking others for money.¬¨‚Ä† I will try very hard to repay you.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†I am still very idealistic, but for twelve years I have been fully aware that I must match my idealism with a very strong work ethic and that I was mistaken in college about studying on Sunday.¬¨‚Ä† In certain, real ways, I have never had much of a chance in life.¬¨‚Ä† My idealism was based on the idea that America was in desperately bad shape and needed timeless wisdom to recover.¬¨‚Ä† I still think America could benefit from the world's best source of not-so common common sense, Aristotle, if that makes sense.¬¨‚Ä† Aristotle has been called \"\"the common sense philosopher\"\".¬¨‚Ä† Reading him, and other old classic western books, is key to being conservative.¬¨‚Ä† This important idea is promoted at Hillsdale College, which I deeply respect.¬¨‚Ä† Democracy is collapsing, but that is something the founding Fathers themselves realized would happen after 1789.¬¨‚Ä† I strongly believe that based on the thought of Plato; Aristotle; the first Duke of Wellington (the British soldier who defeated Napoleon); and Hans Hermann Hoppe.¬¨‚Ä† While I am a patriotic American, supporting the 2nd Amendment and other bedrock American institutions, I believe America has always been decadent and doomed to collapse relatively quickly.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† I want to make the world a much more beautiful and happier place.¬¨‚Ä† I have a lot of talent and a lot of the kind of deep, classical, western-based learning that our universities should be trying to promote instead of rampant political correctness, socialism, and other non-western ideas.¬¨‚Ä† I even used to have great physical charisma, the remnants of which I still hope to use to get married and transmit to my children some day.¬¨‚Ä† I would be willing to marry a woman from a poor country, if necessary.¬¨‚Ä† Maybe my [future] children [since I have never slept with anybody or otherwise had children] can use their charisma to become famous leaders and spread a love of morality, personal responsibility, and liberty to future generations.¬¨‚Ä† I'm not pretentious or arrogant, but very humble and embarrassed.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† Unfortunately, I would love to have enough money to head to the hills as soon as possible.¬¨‚Ä† I would have been planning this a month ago, but my health is bad enough that I could not plan as quickly as I wanted.¬¨‚Ä† Yes, I am goofy and very awkward, but as goofy as I am, I can do enormous good with my life.¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä† ¬¨‚Ä†PLEASE HELP ME SAVE MY OWN LIFE.",

Even if they have one of the best medical services in Europe they simply cannot deal with it as there are not enough spaces in hospitals and the staff is under incredible pressure. I, personally have been affected by having friends and family living there but this fund raising campaign is for every single one of the people affected by the virus even if not directly.¬¨‚Ä†  So I would like to raise some funds and donate them to hospitals around Lombardy and other regions around the country to help them improve the intensive and sub-intensive care. Some of the things are need to be done:   - More beds   - Medical Systems to help breathing.   - Help the staff who currently are working non-stop.   - No more deciding who to save and who not.¬¨‚Ä†    It is in this unimaginable situation that the help of each and everyone of use is vital. Even 1¬¨¬£ each will make the difference.¬¨‚Ä† I thank you in advance for your help!   ///////////////////////////////////////    !!!!!AIUTATE PER FAVORE!!!!!

Io personalmente sono affetto da questa situazione avendo li famigliari e amici ma questa raccolta di fondi e' per tutti quelli coinvolti e affetti dal virus anche se indirettamente.  Quindi vorrei raccogliere pi‚àöœÄ soldi possibili e donarli tutti agli ospedali in lombardia e in tutto il paese per aiutarli a aumentare i posti per la cura intensiva e per i problemi respiratoti, per riuscire a gestire pi‚àöœÄ persone possibili e non lasciare nessuno indietro. queste sono alcune delle cose di cui hanno bisogno bisogno:   - Pi‚àöœÄ posti letto   - Sistemi per aiutare la respirazione assistita.   - Aiutare lo staff e i medici che stanno lavorando in prima linea e stanno facendo sforzi inimmaginabili .   - Evitare che loro stessi debbano decidere chi vive e chi muore.   E'¬¨‚Ä† proprio in queste situazioni che l'aiuto di ciascuno di noi e' vitale. Anche con donazioni da 1 Euro / Sterlina si puo fare la differenza. Vi ringrazio in Anticipo per il vostro aiuto!",

            "description": "Dear Ward 3 Neighbors,  As the COVID-19 crisis continues to grow, so do the needs of our community across the city. Loss of income means many families can't afford basic necessities right now, including low-income people right here in Ward 3. In its first week of operation, the Ward 3 Mutual Aid team answered dozens of calls for help with groceries and hygiene supplies. Thanks to the  incredible preparedness of local Black and Brown women organizers , our first deliveries were funded by a loan from the Wards 7 8 mutual aid group.  This is testament to the immense labor of love currently being undertaken by those who already carry so much.   The  DC Mutual Aid Network ¬¨‚Ä†now has fundraisers covering every ward.  But some wards have greater concentrations of wealth than others.  The median income of White families in Washington, DC is $132,640. The median income of Black families in the District is $42,478. Ward 3 is 81% White. Wards 7 8 are both 92% Black. (Source: dchealthmatters.org) Unequal access to medical facilities is  just as alarming  as the racial wealth gap, especially as Covid19 infections surge in DC.  East of the River, West of the Park: this is the tale of an apartheid city.   Now more than ever, we need Ward 3 to step up and help us fundraise: not just for our Ward 3 neighbors, but for EVERYONE in the city -- especially the most impacted communities in Wards 7 and 8.  The more that we can fundraise, the more that we can send to our fellow organizers East of the River.¬¨‚Ä†   Let's show all of DC how much #Ward3Cares.¬¨‚Ä†   The money you will donate will go to the following goods and services: - Fund grocery deliveries to people who have been impacted the most by the virus and/or cannot leave their homes. - Get medical and disinfecting supplies to care workers, volunteers, and \"\"essential workers.\"\" - Get supplies to create hygiene care packages for needy community members. - Procure materials to produce masks for those who need them the most such as the homeless, hospital workers, nurses, doctors, grocery workers, and more. - Stock up on goods more abundantly available in Ward 3 and make bulk deliveries to other wards.¬¨‚Ä† - Provide any other mutual aid request put out by the DC community, especially those in marginalized communities.  Financial transparency: This is a grassroots effort, so we do not have an organizational bank account. Funds are transferred into an account opened by organizer Sara Swetzoff exclusively for this mutual aid effort. A small group group of admins have access to the linked PayPal account in order to reimburse service providers and grocery runners. We are meticulously tracking our spending: receipts and spreadsheets of all financial transactions can be made available to any donor upon request.  Thank you for your donation!

Recently I have transitioned into a new position with a new company, that doesn't look like they have any plans to provide employees with any paid sick leave for this virus, on top of that, I have recently serious tooth issues that require immediate attention (Need a root canal, and need two extractions, as I am currently dealing with chronic headaches, throbbing cheeks, sores, and pain constantly from an abscess, where I had a root canal done prior in my mid teens nearly 15 years ago, never got it capped, thus became infected, and is finally coming back to haunt me at the worst possible time).¬¨‚Ä† All my funds been allocated into getting this taken care of, as abscesses in the teeth, if ignored for long enough, can be fatal.¬¨‚Ä† I'll be honest, I'm pretty scared, considering I'm in this transition period in life, life is finally looking up, trying to make a life for myself with tech repair, and saving up all I can to fix my teeth (not insured).¬¨‚Ä† All of this is just horrible timing.¬¨‚Ä† I need whatever help I can get, no matter what amounts, to go into an emergency fund, as I'll have nothing left after I get my teeth fixed (Appointment is on Wednesday for my two extractions).¬¨‚Ä† Honestly I wasn't even sure if the amount I was asking for was appropriate, I just figured I would reach out, and ask you all.¬¨‚Ä† I apologize for being all over the place in this description, reaching out and simply asking for help is not in my nature, and makes me very uncomfortable.

Help Reconstruction!¬¨‚Ä†  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is sill under way in China, especially in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. Wuhan and at least 15 other cities (including Huanggang, Huangshi, Jingzhou, Yichang, ... ) have been quarantined as China attempts to halt the spread of the coronavirus. That's more than 50 million people on lockdown. Plenty of stress but shortage of everything else for these cities. There are not enough hospitals and not enough beds, not enough doctors and not enough nurses, not enough rubber gloves and not enough face masks. Millions of people are suffering from infections, panic attacks, and even death in these lockdown cities. Things are worst in many small cities.¬¨‚Ä†  Lots of families are faced with the difficult task of recovery and reconstruction after disaster. Many of them lost their family members during outbreak. Many of them have serious after-effects of a disaster, especially for children and young people.¬¨‚Ä† Many of them are devastated by the coronavirus . They need help. They need our support.¬¨‚Ä†  Let's help China defeat 2019-nCov.¬¨‚Ä† We will continue to help persons in affected areas of China (Wuhan and other seriously affected cities) to overcome this crisis and build back their life.

            "description": "Hello everyone, we started to love our kittens since the first day we saw them behind the glass wall of Petsmart. At the time they were only 5 months old, and even if we only wanted 1 kitten, we could not separate a brother from a sister, so we decided to take responsibility for the both of them. We named them  Hiro , the male and shy one, and  Brago , the female and playful one.¬¨‚Ä†  We started to notice that these kittens had chronic diarrhea and puke, although we went numerous times to different vets they always said that they were healthy and since they are kitten it was normal and it would go away with time. We tried different medications, all of them very expensive, and we couldn't get insurance because they were sick from day 1. We tried contacting the place where we got them from, but they didnt help us, instead they blamed it in the rescue company they got the kittens from. We also called them, but again they blame it on somebody else. Nobody helped us, financially and emotionally.  Finally, after a couple of months, we saved some money and decided to do a more serious and complete check up. That's when we discovered that they both had 3 different rate viruses: - tritrichomonas foetus/blagburni¬¨‚Ä†   -feline coronavirus   -C. Perfringens alpha toxin¬¨‚Ä†   The vet himself couldn't believe it, and told us he has never seen all these disease in one cat at the same time. The feline coronavirus is a  very serious desease,  to explain in human terms it can be compared to cancer. The other 2 illness are rare and treatments are expensive.¬¨‚Ä†  Unfortunately, we do not have the finances to support them, but we do love our kittens so much, they always sparkle our days. We want to give them justice, they haven't even been an year old yet, we want them to be healthy and to live a long happy life. They did not deserve the way they were treated from these institutions (which I will not name because we are tired of all the fights through phones and emails).¬¨‚Ä†  Any sort of help will make a difference. I will thank each and every one of you till my days for your contribution. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this. Let's fight this together for Hiro and Brago, who cant defend and speak for themselves, and so we'll do it.",

The primary purpose of school is to promote academic learning, but it is also the place where our students eat two meals a day, receive emotional support, socialize and develop friendships, find joy in art and music, and exercise at gym and recess. School provides students with structure and routine, but more importantly, it offers a community where children feel cared for by adults and peers. We are truly devastated that we can no longer provide this safe haven for our students.  Our home school of P.S. 75, located on 95th and West End Avenue, currently has 24 students living in shelters and temporary housing; these students who previously sought a respite from their circumstances at school will now be restricted to learning and living in their temporary homes. While the DOE is working to distribute iPads and provide free WiFi to students so they can participate in online learning, there is no timeline for when these learning tools will be attained by students. We are looking to provide these children with workbooks, activities, and games to entertain and engage them during this difficult time. All materials purchased will be shipped directly to our students at their current addresses. Although we understand this is a distressing time for all of us, we feel it is our responsibility as a community to support those who are most vulnerable, and urge you to please donate if you are able to.",

The doctors, nurses and healthcare staff who are treating COVID19 patients need these supplies the most.  With our strong personal networks, we're able to immediately secure masks from certified manufacturers that can be shipped in a week.  100% of donations go directly to the purchase and delivery of N95 masks for frontline healthcare workers in Austin.   In Italy, 1 in every 10 Coronavirus cases are healthcare workers. The head of Italy‚Äö√Ñ√¥s medical association gave his life when he continued to see patients, even when masks ran out. We must not let what happened in Italy happen here in Austin.  While we recognize masks are needed everywhere, we're working to ensure that local businesses aren't left out of the picture. The more funding we secure now, the more masks we can quickly get into healthcare workers' hands.¬¨‚Ä†  Along with practicing your own health safety measures, now is your chance to directly save lives on the front lines. Even a donation of $3, the average price of just one mask, can save so many people‚Äö√Ñ√Æwhat an incredible difference you can personally make. Please give generously today and share this campaign broadly with your networks.   FAQ    How will the funds be used?   100% of the funds go directly to facilitating the purchase and delivery of N95 masks.¬¨‚Ä† Our entire team volunteers their time and have foregone compensation for work. No one benefits financially in any way from this campaign. We're working to ensure that our suppliers give us the most competitive rates available for genuine medical-grade masks so that we can make sure that each dollar raised is maximized.¬¨‚Ä†   Why only Austin?   We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re a team of Austinites and so we have established relationships with healthcare professionals locally.   Aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t the hospitals   government ordering these masks directly?   Yes, they're trying their best to procure masks. However, due to supply chain limitations and global competition, they are currently experiencing extreme shortages. We are fortunate to have close relationships with many of the factories producing masks and will leverage these partnerships.¬¨‚Ä†   I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve seen other charity efforts related to COVID-19. How is this one different?   Ours is directly related to the supply of masks in Austin.   How much are you paying for the masks?   We are getting manufacturer pricing on the masks, but the approximate price hovers around $3 per mask. As pricing depends on order quantity, shipping rate (in this case, the faster the better to protect our healthcare workers), and competing demand, the number may change. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re working to get the best possible price per unit while making sure that each manufacturer has the right certifications and approvals.   Are donations tax-deductible?   Currently, donations are not tax-deductible. We have realized that the need is so urgent that we must move forward and hope that you will donate.¬¨‚Ä†   I am a ER/ICU healthcare professional at an Austin facility currently treating COVID-19 patients. We are short on masks. How do we request masks?¬¨‚Ä†  Contact us here:   https://www.aaacrf.com/contact     Aside from donations, how can I help?

About two months ago he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr‚àö¬© syndrome if you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know what that is, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s is a serious health problem that occurs when the body's defense (immune) system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. This leads to nerve inflammation that causes muscle weakness or paralysis and other symptoms. That day I cried my eyes out and my whole world turned upside down. But when I looked at Liam he had the greatest joy and giggled when I said peek a boo, your my little sunshine. It breaks my heart knowing that one day my baby boy could die. But he is stronger than anything in the whole wide world and he has a heartOf gold. For the past two months I have been going to specialists and surgeons and doctors appoints to get some info on how it gets better and about twoDays ago Dr. Leung contacted me and said there is an experimental treatment but because he is so young it will cost a lot of money and me and my wife Lauren can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t handle the cost. The surgery is Spinal tap (lumbar puncture). A small amount of fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal in your lower back. The fluid is tested for a type of change that commonly occurs in people who have Guillain-Barr‚àö¬© syndrome. That alone cost us $18,000. But that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not the problem the treatment is Immunoglobulin therapy. Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein (intravenously). High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barr‚àö¬© syndrome. And cause it to dissipate to the point where he is clean and healthy and it cost us around $73,450. This treatment could allow me to be able to teach my son Liam how to play baseball ‚Äö√∂√¶√î‚àè√® and I would truly love that just as much as he would love to go to the park and enjoy life.

            "description": "I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m a self employed manicurist that was renting a station from a salon.. all technician felt it was safer for the community and ourselves to close temporarily due to the virus. As much as I wanted to work so I can have a income but the health of my kids and older parents were much more important.. the truth is, before the virus begun I had a vehicle that needed repairs that exceeded $4,500.00. I had to pay the machanic because he completed the job. But it was the worse time to lose my job and spent my savings to fix my other car. (My current car has 200k miles already).. so it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s hard to keep the kids occupied all day. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m doin school work with them but need funds to buy crafts and toys for activities to keep them busy. Not sure how long work and school will be out. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m just trying to seeif I can get money for activities. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not looking to shop for myself or clothes. Not sure how long before all ¬¨‚Ä†the stores close down. So looking to purchase crafts soon. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m sure everyone is hurting too.. my priority was to serve my community and do my part to prevent the spread of the virus.. any penny counts !!! Stay safe everyone",

So here‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the deal: if I raise $2,000 by April 5th, I'm going to dye my hair. For every $10 you donate, you get one vote on the new hair color. So there‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll be a little more color in some of those Zoom meetings! Moreover, I will personally match $500 in donations.   My husband and I are each splitting the money that we raise between the communities where we work and other Americans in need.  He is contributing to tipped workers in D.C.  , and I will be giving half of the funds raised to  students in need here in Pittsburgh ¬¨‚Ä†. (For those of you who don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know, I work for the University of Pittsburgh; Hail to Pitt!) The rest will go to the neediest Americans across the country, via an organization called  GiveDirectly .  Please contribute what you can; and don't forget to indicate in a comment‚Äö√Ñ√Æafter you donate‚Äö√Ñ√Æwhich hair color you are voting for!¬¨‚Ä† (For now, please limit your vote to ONE hair color; under the circumstances, this is going to be an at-home operation and I'm not sure I trust my husband to do \"\"rainbow\"\"...

Its given us the opportunity to build great personal and professional relationships.¬¨‚Ä† It is our home and the people of Hong Kong are our community.¬¨‚Ä†  The coronavirus has spread to HK and the exact course it will take is unknown. Currently, the focus of many HK citizens is prevention and the ability to take care of themselves and their family. There has been a run on basic supplies, lack of supplies and retailers who take advantage by price gauging. Some call this survival instincts, hysteria and others think it's fueled my rumors. Either way, the reality is people gain peace of mind when they have reserves of necessities and others simply do not have the means to procure them.  My family and I were able to leave HK before the virus spread and receive daily requests to send supplies from the US back. Many of the requests come from work colleagues, other factory owners and my own China workers/team.  The main requests are:  Face Masks - basic surgical and N95¬¨‚Ä† Hand Sanitizer Antibacterial Wipes - for hands and home Lysol Disinfectant Spray¬¨‚Ä† Toilet Paper¬¨‚Ä†  We purchased a lot of supplies ourselves but ask our friends and community to help in our ability to do more. We hope through fund raising we can purchase larger quantities and more frequently ship items back by Fedex (USPS suspended shipping to HK/China).  None of the items purchased through fund raising will be put to personal use. We will disseminate the products to the families of our factory workers , local cleaners, the elderly (drop off at local elderly homes and centers) and charities who help those with limited financial means.  We truly appreciate all the support, concern and love.",

Together, we have raised over a $1 million dollars for our neighbors.¬¨‚Ä†   This time I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m asking you to join me in supporting those around us in a dire moment for so many.   With the economic impacts of COVID-19 hitting New York City, the Food Bank for NYC anticipates ‚Äö√Ñ√∫an extreme rise in demand for food in the coming weeks.‚Äö√Ñ√π ( https://www.instagram.com/p/B9pj7bFB0ZN/ )   Why? Cancellations of large events, fewer people at restaurants, and school closings means that wage workers who live on hourly pay + tips are going to be having a harder time than usual making ends meet. It also means that some adults and children who rely on meals from these places may struggle with hunger. We need to make sure that the non-profits who serve our communities have the resources both to keep their volunteers and staff healthy and to provide food to meet rising demand.¬¨‚Ä†   Every $1 donation to the Food Bank For NYC provides 5 meals to those at risk.   We may need to socially distance ourselves to flatten the curve of infection, but we also need to reach out and support our neighbors any way we can. Luckily the internet makes that pretty easy. Donate now. Support your own local food bank. Check on your friends and family.   We are family, and family looks out for one another.   Thank you,  Frederick Joseph (@FredTJoseph)",

            "description": "Due to the current Coronavirus outbreak or pandemic, it is better to provide prevention of sick people exposing themselves to the general public.  A friend of mine had told me about a thermal imaging device that captures pictures of that person and gantry control with A.I. which was invented by a Chinese company during this crisis. They are working around the clock to provide to the Chinese government and companies.  It can detect heat signatures over 37 degrees and gives a warning. It can also be incorporated into gantry and autogate systems. Putting up these devices at the entrance of shopping malls, supermarkets, churches can help to detect those people with fever (common symptoms of Coronavirus, SARS, MERS, etc.). Then a security officer can advise the sick to go home and rest.  Places and areas like (trains, buses, restaurants, malls, cinemas, stadiums, etc.) are common spread of viruses to the mass public. So prevention is always better than cure.  Currently, these devices are only in the Chinese language and I have requested them to do an English version. They are too busy to just produce an English unit and send it as a sample. They will provide an update tool (APP) so that I can do changes myself if I make a purchase. The cost of one unit is AUD$4000. So I hoping that through gofundme, I can get these funds to do my first purchase then make the language update and then send out this sample to respective businesses and government agencies for them to test and get them to start helping the general public with better detection.",

            "description": "We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve put $1k into a fundraiser for comedians to use in helping mitigate the effects of the coronavirus disaster on comedians and their communities. We hope that our willingness to \"\"put our money where our mouth is\"\" will motivate some of you to pull together to protect the most vulnerable members of our communities (comedy and our neighborhoods) during the emergency we are dealing with.  Many comedians already live on shoestring budgets. As the crisis deepens, things are going to get worse. Comics are especially vulnerable because we are not considered legal employees, which means we aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eligible for the unemployment benefits and sick pay that the government is extending to deal with the pandemic.  We want to use this fund to incentivize comedians to serve the most vulnerable members of our communities, while also giving them some financial relief during the crisis. If we can build this into a large movement, we can grow our donor base to provide more assistance to struggling comedians as things get worse. And we can also build a platform to start making demands like UBI and universal food stamps to help the most vulnerable among us survive.  All of the disbursements will be decided case-by-case based on the criteria listed below. If you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re doing work that helps people survive who are most vulnerable to coronavirus, we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll pay you. As we grow, we will be able to provide more to comedians. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s essentially an honor system, but we do expect people to post on social media about how they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re helping the cause. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re dealing with an emergency and we need to act fast; we don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have time for bureaucracy. You tell us how much to give you, and what for (based on criteria below), and we pay you from the fund via PayPal (or something else if necessary).  Look, the rule is what Jessica Jones said to Jesse Pinkman - DBAA: Don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t Be An Asshole.   Here‚Äö√Ñ√¥s an overview of what the fund will be used for (details further down):   - Paying comedians $25/week to do deliveries from stores that don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t offer delivery (dollar stores and convenience stores) for people who shop in those stores who are especially vulnerable to fatality from the virus: people who are sick, disabled, elderly (60+ y/o), immunocompromised, and have other health conditions. This includes online SNAP orders from WalMart.  - Paying comedians $25/week to do deliveries to those vulnerable groups from food pantries such as Philabundance and Food Not Bombs. Also doing grocery/supply runs for senior housing communities.  - Paying comedians to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫bulk‚Äö√Ñ√π shop from dollar/convenience stores for their roommates/friends/neighbors, in order to reduce the overall amount of people who are congregating in stores. $5/person you shop for, with a limit of $25 overall per week. One trip for multiple people, not individual trips for each person.  - Paying comedians to order their groceries/supplies online. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll pay the tip and delivery/ordering service fee, plus $2 per order. Be sure to read details below.  - If you need food/supplies, we will do our best to help you work something out via a food pantry and/or mutual aid network in your area.  - If you have other ideas, let us know.  If you are doing any of these things, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s important that you share what you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re doing on social media (be safe if you're doing deliveries). That will enable us to get more people involved and build this into a national movement of comedians. Hopefully other people who work in entertainment will take up the cause with us.  Twitter -  https://twitter.com/ComsCoronaER  FB -  https://facebook.com/comedianscoronaresponse     *** Everyone Can Contribute ***   Even if you aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t doing any of the things listed above, you can still help:  - Talk to people in your network and promote what we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re doing on social media to help make this a larger movement. Share the posts we make from our official social media accounts. People are sitting at home by themselves all day on the internet and feeling isolated. This can make them feel like they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re part of something again, and erase their feelings of helplessness about the situation.  - If you are financially secure, donate what you can. Use your platforms to urge wealthy comics to support our efforts.  - If you must have some kind of in-person financial interaction, pay ahead with a credit card if possible. The virus can survive on cash. Yes, we all understand about tips being paid in cash being better for the worker. But safety and survival are paramount right now.    *** The Future ***   Prepare yourselves to live like this for months or even a year. This will be the most significant event in American history since 9/11, and probably since World War II. Things will not be back to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫normal‚Äö√Ñ√π when it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s over; we will be living in a different world.  The mood will be more somber and serious, which will likely reduce demand for comedy. The overall economy will be in a severe recession.  After 9/11, people were terrorized and docile. The US government responded by expanding the police state with the Patriot Act, and globally starting 2 major imperial wars‚Äö√Ñ¬∂all with little resistance from Americans.  After the last recession in 2008 (and this may ring echoes in your ears): ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.‚Äö√Ñ√π History has given us no reason to believe events will play out any differently this time. The chant rang out three years too late last time, in 2011 at Occupy Wall Street. People were finally ready to fight evictions and foreclosures, but most of the damage was already done.  We can write a different story, but we have to organize now. Not just as comedians, but as workers. We need to get past the idea of competing with each other for money and fame, and think about the collective struggle for survival. Whether you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re a 10-year comedy veteran working 4 sets in clubs every weekend, or an open mic‚Äö√Ñ√¥er waiting tables at a small diner, you are both susceptible to the unforgiving nature of the market economy.  Banks and landlords don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t care how many headlining spots you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had if you can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t pay your mortgage or rent. They, with the help of the government, will try to do what they did in the wake of the 2008 recession: force the working class to eat the losses. And the government will certainly try to expand the police state.  This time we have to fight back. It starts with working class solidarity. Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s get to work.    *** Performing Deliveries ***   We know $25/week isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t much for the deliveries, but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s heroic work. If we do enough of it, we will save lives. The fewer people in the stores, the better. The reasons to not pay more are:  1) We want to spread the money around to as many people who need it as possible to make this a fast-growing movement and  2) We need to minimize the losses from people who will inevitably lie and take the money without needing it or contributing anything.  Everyone should act as though they are already infected, even if they are asymptomatic, and take whatever measures possible to not spread it. If you feel sick at all, stay home. We will try to provide masks, disinfectant spray/wipes, disposable gloves, and sanitizer for deliverers...but these items are hard to come by right now.  Deliveries should be left outside the door to avoid close interaction. Credit Card over the phone would be ideal, but you could also exchange money under the door.  - For dollar/convenience store delivering: You would talk to someone who works in the store (ideally it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a place you go regularly so they already know you) and explain what you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re doing. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re going to write something up that can be posted on the entrance to stores as a message telling vulnerable people to stay home and order for delivery (you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll put your phone number). It would say no fee and no tip expected. Some people will offer to tip anyway because that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s how they are. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll figure out the logistics as we go.  We should also inform people that they can use a service like Postmates for dollar/convenience store deliveries, and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s best for as many people as possible to do that if they can afford to. It would be good to do research and find the most cost-effective service for your particular store.  - For food pantries and senior housing: Show up, tell someone in charge you want to help and make deliveries to vulnerable people who need to be staying home.  - Transportation cost: Ideally you‚Äö√Ñ√¥d do deliveries on foot or bike in your neighborhood, but if you have to drive or take public transportation, let us know the situation and we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll discuss.    *** Ordering Groceries/Supplies for Delivery ***   We have some info below on Walmart and Instacart, but please contact us first before you place a delivery order you plan to be reimbursed for. We want to use the most cost-effective options whenever possible, and also learn about other apps/services so we can provide more information to people.  We want everyone to encourage the people they know to get their groceries delivered, and to pay for the added cost themselves if they can. If you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re someone who can afford to pay the added cost for yourself and others who find it cost-prohibitive, then go ahead and pay for them. If you can pay for yourself, but not others, then we will pay for their fees/tip, plus $2. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll take these on a case-by-case basis in terms of how many people (who aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t comedians that we know) we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re willing to pay for.  If you do this with roommates/neighbors, try to order collectively and get enough to last everyone at least 2 weeks.  - You should first look to see if you can order everything you need from a store that offers free delivery (over $35) like Walmart. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll still give you $2.  - Instacart Express partners with the most stores. It offers no delivery fee for the first 14 days after signup, and a $1 or $2 service fee. You can have up to 6 addresses on the account at a time; we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll see how that goes. When you sign up, make sure to leave the notification that emails you 3 days before the trial period ends (14 days) when you will get charged $99. When you get that notification, contact us, and we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll figure out how to move forward.  Be aware that your order history will be visible to anyone with access to the account, so keep that in mind if you might not feel comfortable with certain people seeing what you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re ordering. Also, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s probably best to not store your credit card number on a shared account. Even if there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s no malicious intent, someone could accidentally use the wrong one.  ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Standard‚Äö√Ñ√π tip on Instacart is 10%. We recommend 15-20%.  Minimum delivery amount for free delivery is $35, so please order at least that much at a time.  - We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll figure out other services like Postmates and DoorDash as we go.",

Our small business,  Simple   Sentimental , typically creates personalized gifts, but we are stepping up and using our resources to create face shields for healthcare workers at  Vidant Medical Center  in Greenville, North Carolina. We are also sending donations to hospitals around the country, please continue reading to learn how you can send our face shields to your local hospital!  The primary hospital we are donating to, Vidant, serves 29 counties in Eastern North Carolina. They are asking for donations of face shields and other PPE to protect nurses, doctors, and other vital healthcare personnel working to take care of COVID-19 patients. Because Vidant serves so many counties, they are also a distributor to other hospitals and medical facilities. Any donations we take to Vidant are sent to the area with the most need.  We estimate our cost of creating a face shield is $8 per shield, so  for every $8 donation we receive, we are making and donating 1 face shield to  Vidant Medical Center.¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä†  If you donate more than $100, we can ship the face shields produced by your donation to the hospital of your choosing (must be in the continental United States). ¬¨‚Ä† If you donate $100 or more, we will message you via GoFundMe to see which hospital you would like them to be sent to. Please have their shipping address ready :) All other donations will be sent to Vidant Medical Center in Greenville.  We are able to produce up to 400 face shields per day, and we would love to fulfill Vidant's and Eastern NC's growing need of PPE. Below is a photo of what our face shields look like! We make them in our office in Greenville out of plastic.     I hope you will consider donating to our GoFundMe so we can support the people who are putting their health and even their lives on the line to save others!   Please reach out if you have any questions! We can also be reached on social media:  Instagram ¬¨‚Ä†  Facebook",

So here we are. If you know Jarrod and myself, you know how incredibly hardworking we are. On Monday of this week, we both lost our jobs. Unfortunately, as restaurant hourly/tipped workers, paid leave isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t an option. We have both taken the steps to apply for unemployment/scholarships, however, that helps for the future. But not right now. Both of our shifts for the month were cut short. And it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s come to the point where we have to talk about what bills to pay to make it through. Crazy. If anyone can help us and has the means to get us through these tough times, anything can help. And a big thank you for everyone who has already reached out to us.  3",

            "description": "Da Silvano  is een  Italiaanse  delicatessenwinkel gerund door ZZP‚Äö√Ñ√πer Silvan Claassens te Middelburg.  Mijn motto en uitgangspunt is altijd geweest‚Äö√Ñ¬∂..  ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Proef het ware Itali‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√π  Altijd heb ik willen werken met kleine locale bedrijven in Itali‚àö¬¥, zodat het ware Itali‚àö¬¥ geproefd kan worden. Ik wil kost wat kost deze producten behouden en kunnen blijven afnemen, zodat de getroffen bedrijven daar, waar ik de mooiste producten van afneem‚Äö√Ñ¬∂.. ook kunnen blijven bestaan!   Ik heb alles op alles gezet om mijn concept aan te passen voor de online menu‚Äö√Ñ√¥s en verkoop, echter dit levert met de winkelverkoop samen nog maar 10% op van de normale verkoop. Kantoren die altijd hun lunch verzorgd wilden zien, hoor ik al sinds begin februari niet meer.  Alle catering is van de ene op de andere dag gestopt. Ik kreeg een regen van annuleringen terwijl wel de kosten al gemaakt waren! Dit alles na de uitbraak in Itali‚àö¬¥ van dit virus!   Mensen blijven thuis, heel begrijpelijk in deze onzekere tijd.. Deze crisis heeft hierdoor een grote impact op mijn bedrijf. Ik zou er graag nog willen zijn met mijn winkel als deze crisis achter de rug is. Maar‚Äö√Ñ¬∂. ook voor mij is het moeilijk, ik behoor helaas ook tot de risicogroep!  Mijn Italiaanse delicatessenwinkel ben ik met veel enthousiasme gestart, maar helaas eind 2018 ben ik geconfronteerd met zware hartproblemen (2 hartinfarcten en stilstanden). Dit heb ik overleefd en ben vol goede moed weer gestart! Alles is weer op de rit en nu overvalt ons allen deze vreselijke Corona-crisis!  Zolang het mogelijk is probeer ik de winkel draaiende te houden. Ik zie echter geen mogelijkheid meer dit vol te houden tot‚Äö√Ñ¬∂. wanneer‚Äö√Ñ¬∂.??? De Italiaanse leveranciers leveren al sinds begin februari geen of weinig producten, zodat ik al niet meer kan voldoen aan sommige vragen van de klanten. De huur en rekeningen lopen echter door en ik zou echt niet weten hoe ik dit verder kan oplossen met deze sterk verminderde omzet. Ik sta nu met mijn rug tegen de muur.  Ik zou het zeer waarderen als jullie mij willen helpen deze tijd te overbruggen. Ik leg al mijn schroom neer en vraag u om een vrijwillige donatie om straks als alles achter de rug is door te kunnen gaan zoals vanouds. Als blijk van waardering voor uw donatie krijgt u van mij als ik na de Lockdown weer gewoon kan doorgaan: bij een donatie van ‚Äö√á¬® 6 tot ‚Äö√á¬® 15 - Een heerlijke Italiaanse zoetigheid bij een donatie van ‚Äö√á¬® 15 tot ‚Äö√á¬® 50 - Een panini naar keuze bij een donatie van ‚Äö√á¬® 50 of hoger - Een traiteurmenu voor 2 personen  Bij voorbaat hartelijk dank!   U kunt altijd nog per mail¬¨‚Ä† of telefoon 06 20900900 bestellen bij mij. Indien voorradig wil ik het graag voor u klaar maken en kunt u het op afspraak afhalen / of ik bezorg het aan huis. Ik zal jullie op alle social media op de hoogte houden hoe alles verder zal lopen en zal gaan.   Een goede gezondheid is de grootste rijkdom, dit wens ik jullie allemaal.

            "description": "For the next two weeks while businesses and schools are closed due to the worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus, many individuals in the Farmington Valley community will not be able to secure needs that they would typically be able to get under normal circumstances. Food-insecure students might find it harder to secure their meals, people living paycheck-to-paycheck might not be able to earn for themselves, and many might need rent assistance.  For these reasons, it is critical that we in the Farmington Valley community lend a hand (or many) to our friends and neighbors in need, but many of our volunteers cannot afford to give rides or distribute food from money out of their own pockets. With your kind donations, we will be able to fulfill the material needs of our community without putting major strain on our volunteers, most, if not all, of whom are high school and college students.¬¨‚Ä†  If you cannot donate, feel free to reach out and volunteer!

            "description": "Hello neighbors! It all started when my sister-in-law from Wisconsin posted a picture of herself with a box on N95 masks on the family photo stream. She is an Amazon seller and have been running her successful business for many years now.¬¨‚Ä† I laughed and told her, \"\"You guys are crazy! Where did you get all those masks?!\"\" She said she found a supplier and planned on sending me some. I was not sure if I really needed them but I figured why not, right?! Better safe than sorry!   That same day a post from a nurse at Newton-Wellesley Hospital asked the Holliston community for help in donating masks. I thought about my sister-in-law and texted her. \"\"Can I buy some from the supplier?\"\" I asked. \"\"Nurses and doctors at the front line here are pleading the public to donate masks and I liked to order and donate.\"\" She said no need. She will donate what she has and she immediately overnighted me 500 masks at a shipping costs of $120 - crazy! I told her I would pay the shipping and it arrived at my front door the next day.¬¨‚Ä† By the 3rd day, 500 N95 masks have been divided and donated to nurses and doctors in 9 area hospitals and the Holliston Fire Department.¬¨‚Ä† Thanks to neighbors who offer to come by and picked them up and drop them off!!  Many people have asks since how they can help. I tried to connect hospitals administrator to my sister-in-law but she said no one from the hospitals called but plenty of individual doctors, nurses and their family members wanting to buy masks to protect their love ones called.¬¨‚Ä† I asked the doctors and nurses that came by to pick up the masks why not just call and order and get the supplies ASAP? The answer was always the same - too much bureaucracy and red tape. Any new vendors must fill out paperwork, have them submitted and approved before any orders can be made - I was told. Meanwhile, nurses and doctors work without masks. One drove over an hour from Wincester to pick up 25 masks from me.¬¨‚Ä† I couldn't believe it.  So now I am starting a GoFundMe page to help our nurses, doctors, EMTs and anyone at the frontline trying to keep all of us safe. If you can donate, my sister-in-law will purchase the masks for us to donate to area hospitals. We are still working out the most affordable and efficient method as it is hard to buy just a few masks from suppliers/manufacturers. So I have set a modest $2100 goal to try and see if we can get1000 masks ($2 per masks) delivered by the end of the week.¬¨‚Ä†¬¨‚Ä†  Please donate if you can. Thank you.",

            "description": " It is time for all of us to unite together and join the fight against covid19.    MASK FOR AMERICA  Project Highlight:  -  Hospitals in the US are running out of medical supplies  such as face masks, cover gowns, and other personal protective equipment (PPE) due to a nationwide shortage caused by the Coronavirus outbreak.  -  Doctors and nurses who fight against Covid19 at the frontline are desperately need our help!   -  We are asking you to join the fight together  with our medical workers, help them get those PPE they need, to keep them safe, healthy and well-protected.  -  MASK FOR AMERICA is a donation-based program , all your donations are going directly to the sourcing and distribution of masks and other PPE for US hospitals and clinics. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re asking for your help in supporting this cause.  -  We hope to distribute throughout the US as more funds come in.  We are based in Chicago, IL and will start by providing PPE to Chicagoland hospitals and clinics.¬¨‚Ä†  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Our Goal   Commitment    With this project, we are looking to procure as many N95 and surgical masks as we can for donations. Our goal is to protect the health of as many healthcare workers across Illinois and the US as possible. If we are going to stop this virus in its tracks, we will need our brave healthcare professionals in good health.  If we hit our initial goal of $40,000, we will be able to purchase approximately ten thousand each N95 masks and surgical masks from the vetted suppliers and ship them to hospitals treating COVID19 patients.  We are committed to donating the equipment we acquire through this initiative to hospitals and doctors that need them most urgently. We plan to make our first donations to hospitals in Chicago starting with  University of Illinois Hospital. ¬¨‚Ä†  If you or someone you know works for a hospital/clinic that treats COVID19 related patients and is in need of PPE, please have them fill the form below so we can arrange our donations.    https://forms.gle/9KJ8TfQqTqWaiKsw9  ¬¨‚Ä†  Please keep check back in with us as we make progress towards our goal.   Why are we doing this?   When I first moved to the United States, people often asked me how I like it here. I always share my opinion about I love the strong sense of community that US people have. I always wanted to be part of it and show my gratitude to my community by being helpful.  When the coronavirus outbreak first started in China, there was a huge shortage of medical supplies in almost every hospital. As someone who paid close attention to the matter, I quickly contacted my friend Lizaa in China and helped finding medical resources. We spent several weeks trying to source available PPE from overseas to help in China‚Äö√Ñ√¥s fight against the coronavirus, after weeks of effort, Lizaa told me that finally the local supply started to catch up with demand.  Unfortunately, one month later, and now the virus has spread across the whole world.  Over the past few days, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve come in touch with several people in healthcare that indicated urgent need for personal protective equipment.  I first saw my neighbor who is an ICU nurse posting on NextDoor to urge people to please stay home. She emphasized that we desperately need to slow things down, because hospitals are already becoming overwhelmed.  Another friend of ours, a wife and mom, works as an ER nurse and her hospital is running very low on masks and they do not know what to do.  I knew I have to do something to help my community. I keep asking myself besides quarantining myself at home, what else can I do? How can we help? And then it occurred to me that we may be able to find PPE supply from China to bring back to the US. Sure enough, our friend who has helped Chinese hospitals acquire these items locally has introduced us to the suppliers. These masks are produced by FDA-approved suppliers and are willing to sell them at a reasonable price. (This is very important, because many of the available masks for public use are not properly vetted or certified and some of their price is just crazy.) Upon making this connection, we felt it was our responsibility to open this channel, but we can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t do it alone.  I view our situation like a war against coronavirus, and our healthcare providers are fighting at the frontline, day and night. The rest of us need to join them and fight together against the virus. We can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t treat patients, but there are still lots of things we can do to help and to contribute, to get ourselves involved, to tell doctors and nurses, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫you are not alone, we are in this together!‚Äö√Ñ√π¬¨‚Ä† That is why I am starting the project ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Mask For America‚Äö√Ñ√π.  These are tough times for everyone as business has slowed down and, in some cases, stopped altogether. For those of you who are able, we greatly appreciate any contributions you make to this effort.   How Can You Help?   As China ramped up its fight against COVID-19, national mask production also increased tremendously. At this moment, US mask production has not yet caught up with demand. ¬¨‚Ä†We have identified manufacturers in China with surplus of N95 and surgical masks as well as other PPE, but no way to distribute them where they are most needed currently (here in the US). For the cost of a cup of Starbucks coffee, we will be able to protect a medical care provider a whole day. Literally no donation is too small! Thank you all for your contribution!   FAQ    What is the current situation in IL?   Like much of the nation, testing is just ramping up here in Illinois. Already hospitals are expressing concern with shortages of proper PPE such as masks and gloves. As of March 22, there are 1,050 confirmed cases in Illinois including 298 new cases, over nearly 150 more new cases than reported on March 21. We should expect for confirmed cases to continue increasing as testing becomes more widely available. This means the supply of PPE is only going to become more stressed over the coming weeks.  \"\" Hospitals all over the state ¬¨‚Ä†are in jeopardy of potentially running out of critically needed protective medical supplies,\"\" IHHSA President A.J. Wilhelmi said. \"\"With continuing uncertainties about global and U.S. supplies of face masks, we urgently need to find alternative supplies, no matter where they are, so our hospitals can continue to provide life-saving care to current and future COVID-19 patients.\"\"  ‚Äö√Ñ√∫We desperately need to slow things down. The medical system in our region is markedly stressed by seasonal viral infections in real time and area hospitals are already seeing multiple COVID19 cases‚Äö√Ñ√π ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ ICU nurse in Lincoln Square posted on Nextdoor, 17th March 2020   Where are all the masks?   As the healthcare system strains¬¨‚Ä†to accommodate the unprecedented challenge of the coronavirus outbreak, many medical professionals on the front lines do not have adequate protection. Some are reusing masks and gloves. Others have taken to social media with public pleas for help using the hashtag #GetMePPE, an acronym for personal protective equipment. Without proper covering, every new bedside visit might prove fatal, especially for older physicians and their families. And already, dozens of health care workers across the country have fallen ill. Hundreds more have been forced into quarantine.  ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The sky is falling,‚Äö√Ñ√π one doctor wrote in an opinion piece for  The New York Times. ¬¨‚Ä†  ¬¨‚Ä†‚Äö√Ñ√∫We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re heading into the abyss,‚Äö√Ñ√π wrote another.  The short supply of masks in particular is dire.",

Wuhan has been quarantined as health officials and the World Health Organization fear a possible global epidemic.  As such, a scarcity of these medical supplies has struck the area, leading many exposed to this dangerous disease. Death tolls are rising and we must act fast.  I am sending M3 ¬¨‚Ä†N95 1860 and 1870 masks, respirators, Tyvex suits, and other relevant medical equipment to hospitals in Wuhan. We are contacting local hospitals and sending these items to hospitals that have put out public requests for supplies. If any hospital from Wuhan or the surrounding areas would like to receive these items from us, please contact us! All money raised from this campaign will go towards the purchase of these supplies, and we are getting ready to complete our first purchases and will update immediately!  We are also looking to partner with hospitals who may have supplies to donate.

During these difficult times of increased fear and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, it is easy to worry about ourselves and our families, stockpiling food   essential supplies in preparation for the worst possible, all whilst forgetting the needy, sick and vulnerable in our own neighborhoods.   The unsettling reality is that many in our neighborhoods and communities do actually depend on a Food Bank for their daily meals. At least 1 out of every 8 Canadian Households faces some form of food insecurity, with more than half of these households consisting of single-income, single-person, the elderly and those living with disabilities. And these numbers are only expected to grow due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, making it hard for those already underprivileged to afford essentials like groceries.¬¨‚Ä†   DawaNet‚Äö√Ñ√¥s HalalServe Food Bank is an important community initiative that provides free bi-weekly Food Baskets to needy   persistently poor families in the Mississauga (Ontario, Canada) area, also offering home delivery to those with limited mobility. Typical baskets include an assortment of fresh produce, fruit, rice/ lentils   legumes, pasta, cereals, fresh milk   eggs, Halal meats, snacks and other healthy food items.   DawaNet would like to remind everyone to be patient, stay optimistic, take the necessary precautions to help protect yourselves and your loved ones against all harm, but to also not forget about HalalServe that provides essential food assistance to the most vulnerable in our local communities.    During COVID-19, please help HalalServe ensure:   Our existing clients continue to receive the basic bi-weekly food assistance we provide them, and¬¨‚Ä† Any additional needy individuals and families in the Mississauga area can be provided assistance via our Urgent Food Assistance program.

            "description": " The Lifeboat project has been set up by Changing Minds Kent CIC to support those affected by and currently living in isolation due to the effects of the Corona-virus.   Our Story...   Changing Minds Kent currently provides social inclusion and skills development opportunities for individuals living in Thanet from our social hub, \"\"The Lodge\"\" based in Westgate-on-sea.  Usually we provide a safe and relaxed environment for individuals to connect with others, improve their overall well-being through our range of activities such as gardening, sports, mindfulness, cookery and much more.   Right now...   We have had to make the hard decision to close the lodge temporarily due to the corona virus pandemic. As much as we did not wish to do this, the health and safety of our friends remains paramount to us and as such we do not wish to risk opening up and going against social distancing recommendations at the moment.  Having said this, we are not willing to sit idly by whilst we have members of our local community who are living in isolation, struggling to get to the shops, connect with other people or even get out for some exercise.¬¨‚Ä†  The lifeboat project has been set up by us to combat this.   Our aims...   We aim to provide mental health support, advice, anxiety management, food and essentials for the local community throughout the Corona virus Pandemic.    *To offer free delivery of care packages for those in isolation within our local community, including food, toiletries   entertainment (Crosswords, card games, coloring books, etc).  *To establish a phone line for those seeking a friendly chat / video chat if possible.  *To set up a¬¨‚Ä†social media hub for individuals to access for tips on combating loneliness whilst in isolation.  *To grow and adapt the project alongside the ever changing situation to provide support for as many affected individuals as we can possibly reach.   What we need...   We have adapted our premises here at the lodge to include a special sanitization station to be used by anyone of the premises and to ensure any deliveries of care packages and provisions are placed in disinfected bags and delivered by volunteers with gloves and other PPE to a safe place chosen by those in isolation who are in need.  We are collecting Food, toiletries and other basic grocery items to create care packages here at the lodge and would like to provide luxury items such as biscuits, board and card games to put in alongside a personalised card from us to let those affected know that we are all thinking of them throughout this difficult time.¬¨‚Ä†  We are also actively seeking a team of volunteers who would be willing to take voice or video calls from those in isolation to simply be a friendly listener and someone to talk to for those who might not have anyone to talk to at the moment due to the crisis.  Unfortunately with panic buying and shortages being rife, this is no easy task, So we need as much help as we can get!   Anything you can give right now would make all the difference to the most vulnerable members of our community. Please, let's pull together and try to help as many people as possible.     Thank you! :)  ",

            "description": "Why are we doing this?  This operation began as a simple conversation among friends and neighbors about what can be done to help slow down the spread of CoVID19 in the US, especially the DFW area. The conversation quickly heated up as we learned that hospitals and medical personnel were running out of personal protective equipment (PPE). Recognizing how devastating this could soon become, the group could no longer sit still. We decided¬¨‚Ä† to do something to help the local and state medical institutions and personnel prepare for the pandemic. We want to unite the community to raise money and PPE for our heroes, the medical professionals fighting against the CoVID19 for all of us.   What will we do?  We understand medical institutions have protocols in vendor specification and logistics. We aim to avoid disrupting existing order and process. There‚Äö√Ñ√¥s also risk and liability involved. However, we decide to move forward to do as much as we can in the following areas based on demand.   Who are our targeting recipients of help?¬¨‚Ä†  Medical professionals, doctors, nurses, caregivers and their family. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll focus on DFW metropolitan but may reach out to Texas state wide as we see fit. High risk groups, including elderly and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.   What will be provided?  PPE with FDA approval. In rare cases, recipients may knowingly accept equipment with lower specification due to lack of more qualified ones. This needs to be explicitly disclosed and agreement signed. Community service to help high risk groups shop or do other errands as needed.   What happens if we have some money and resources left?  There is ZERO overhead for this fund. We're reaching to local hospitals to help. We will donate whatever is left to three institutions: Parkland, Children‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Hospital and UTSW after the virus is contained or the steering committee agrees that the mission is accomplished.",

Coming to the United States in 2018, our couple have also been moved to Christian Theological Seminary to study for a master's degree program in preparation for serving the church in the future.  why you ‚Äö√Ñ√¥re fundraising.  I was originally a photographer. In the United States, I have always paid for my family's living expenses and tuition through my photography work and uber. But the arrival of 2019-nCov stopped my photography business income. The work of the uber driver took into account the need to reach passengers in different countries in the airport. Since I have to go to churches and seminaries frequently, I had to temporarily stop during the insurance period. Work, so I have n‚Äö√Ñ√¥t been able to pay my rent for two months now, and I ca n‚Äö√Ñ√¥t pay for the seminary. I now need to pay rent and tuition for 3 months from February to April by the end of March. The funds raised will keep me from worrying about losing my place of residence and I can concentrate more on theology. We also have a 5-year-old child who needs to be raised. Your support and help will help us through this difficult time. The United States and the American people are great. Thank you very much for your help. May God bless you!",

            "description": "The coronavirus disease started in December 2019. It was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China. The study so far shows that it originated from another animal and subsequently spread between people. Symptoms may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Up to now, there is no vaccine or specific treatment. Patients are treated with symptoms management and supportive therapy.   Up to Feb 21, 2020, over 75,000 people were diagnosed as patients of coronavirus disease. 2236 people died. Since the first week of the outbreak, the medical supplies have been in shortage. None of the hospitals had enough reserves of medical materials. A lot of medical workers and volunteers were almost unprotected.     As young adults, we want to do something for them. Before this benefit concert, we raised around $12,000 and connected with a hospital in Huanggang. The good news is that the supplies we purchased departed on Feb 21 from Chicago to China. And Huanggang Central Hospital will receive them within a few days.¬¨‚Ä†    Please click the link below   for more info of Benefit Concert for Coronavirus Relief at Bard College:   https://www.facebook.com/ziyue.he.9828/posts/101526228115263?__tn__=K-R      Speech from President Leon Botstein at the beginning   With the generous support of Bard College and Bard College Conservatory of Music, we organized a benefit concert within ten days and the result was so inspiring and optimistic that went beyond our expectation.

            "description": "Hello Friends and Family,   The Corona- Velazquez Family has made this GoFund me page to help with medical expenses for Eduardo (Pix) and his family. Many of you might not know but throughout the years Pix has been slowly losing his vision. At first we all thought that his vision was getting worse because of the time and his age, but during the last doctor‚Äö√Ñ√¥s visit in November 2015 we knew something wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t right. The Optometrist we saw said that he could have glaucoma and he sent us to see an Ophthalmologist. We found many of them but none in our network of insurance. At one point Pix was ready to give up and just live with the fact that he would be losing his vision little by little. I finally convinced him in getting it checked out. We found an ophthalmologist in town that would take him ASAP. The Ophthalmologist said we would have to pay for the visit in full and not including any extra test , if required.The first thing we thought was ‚Äö√Ñ√∫How are we going to pay this?‚Äö√Ñ√π $300+ just for the visit and plus the extra test.    After a few test, the Ophthalmologist recommended we get Pix an MRI done due to the test results. He has lost complete vision of his right eye and half of his left. At the time I thought, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫How can he live like this?‚Äö√Ñ√π We were scared but determined to get him the help that he needs. Now we had to find a radiology office that was ‚Äö√Ñ√∫in network‚Äö√Ñ√π once again no luck. 1k out of pocket for the MRI. They told us we could see the results during our next doctor's appointment. It wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t long before his doctor called us a couple hours saying we needed to come to his office immediately. So many thoughts were rushing through our minds, what could it be? All this time we thought it was Glaucoma and that he just needed a better prescription for his glasses. We were completely blind sided.   We were then told that Pix has a Pituitary Adenoma tumor that is located in the top center of his brain and it is pressing against his optic nerve which is causing him to lose his vision. We were sent to Stanford to meet with a Neurosurgeon, but were later denied because of our insurance. We then were sent to another Neurosurgeon in Monterey. We weren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t seen there because they said it was too large for him to perform the surgery. After being bounced back and forth to different doctors, lost wages due to appointments , paid hundreds of dollars to be seen by them, we were finally sent to UCSF. Rated top 4 in the country. With that title we were sure that a huge price tag came with it. Our insurance was in network, but wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t able to pay it all.    Now on June 7, 2016, Pix will finally have his surgery!! The downside to it all is, we have spent a lot of money in just getting to where we are now. We are struggling to pay for his surgery. The surgery will take place in UCSF and will require pre and several post-op visits. Out of pocket costs, which include the amount not covered by insurance as well as travel expenses, will run approximately $10,000. We have hit a roadblock and we need your help. We are glad that the doctors were able to find the tumor before it grew any larger. The tumor is the size of a tomato now and at any given moment it can damage the optic nerve enough that he can go blind and stay like that for the rest of his life. This surgery is very important because Pix has two small children who he wishes to see every single day while they grow up. It would be devastating to not be able to pay for this very important surgery. Any little counts, all will be greatly appreciated!   Thank you from the Corona- Velazquez Family!",

All the money you donate will go to VolunTeens, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based right here in Howard County dedicated to serving those in need. VolunTeens will allocate all the money to buy hot meals from various local restaurants, such as restaurants affected by the Ellicott City floods. We then donate these hot meals to local homeless shelters and support groups, mainly Grassroots. We greatly appreciate all the funds we can get, and we hope to start fundraising as soon as possible to help as many people as we can. To learn more about VolunTeens, visit our  VolunTeens website . Thank you for your support!",

            "description": "Hi there my name is Anthony and I work for Kaiser Permanente here in Oakland, CA but this project has nothing to do with Kaiser, this is all my doing. I just had my 29th birthday and am truly blessed to be able to even think of this project let alone put it into action and am just praying that others will want to do something positive for our neighbors with me. I have lived in the Bay Area my entire life and have seen my home town change so much over the years, but one thing that I noticed is how hard it is to live here when my neighbors and the people of our communities do not work together and help look out for each other. I am aware that many people here in the Bay Area do not have enough money to buy items to protect themselves from the Coronavirus or enough money to keep their hygiene up and stay as clean as possible to help keep the virus away from their home or homeless community. I believe the least we can do is go to the homeless communities in the East Bay Area, like Oakland, and its surrounding areas and provide hand sanitizer stations and/or small travel bottles for people to take with them, hygiene products like tampons/pads and soap, can also provide clean water bottles and foo/or food, can provide correct and reusable breathing masks, and anything else that is recyclable and needed by people in the affected areas. I understand the city of San Francisco has at least some plan in place to provide some services in San Francisco, but what about the entire East Bay on the other side of the bridge? The people of Oakland and the rest of the East Bay are usually forgotten when it comes to government funding compared to the help that the older richer brother, San Francisco, usually gets in favor over Oakland and its residents. So I want to do something, anything that I can to help the women and children and elderly that are not and cannot get prepared for this epidemic. I hope you will all join me in this journey!",

Despite this, we will still see elderly individuals out on their own looking for water and toilet paper, anything we might have failed to grab in our crazed raids.   I know these are frightening times, but we cannot reduce ourselves to anything sub-human and forget about those who are in need. Many of us have young children or grandparents we are concerned for, but not everyone has someone to care for them.  With your help, I can purchase any items I am able to find that will be of use during this period. I can distribute resources within my area - Stockton, Ca. - for as long as I am healthy. If you can't distribute money, take it upon yourself to distribute resources to those in need.  It saddens me to see elderly or needy individuals roaming the aisles of bare shelves fearing they won't have the necessary items to make it through the week, let alone the entirety of the COVID-19 crisis.

She battled and fought and although the cancer has cleared she has had more seizures making it unable for her to work. She was a third grade teacher and misses her career badly. To boot it has cut into her personal money. ¬¨‚Ä†I am raising money for her because I am her friend in San Diego for the last 5 years. The money will go to Bea to help her pay for her ongoing need to get MRI's every month and doctors visits and help her get through with the nessecary day to day needs. Please donate if you can!",

Families are slowly going under, and there is nothing they can do about it. This is just the beginning of what is going to come. What savings they do have will be depleted in the days to come. Our job as a community should be to all stand together and give a hand to help them up. Nobody is asking to be become rich all they need is a little help to keep their family together. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s unfortunate it takes circumstances such as this for us to pull together and help one another out, but I pray that we may still make it through this and come out on top. The whole community.. all for one and one for all... nobody left behind. Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s show the corona virus what strong people we are and take a stand and fight back. We will not be lost and weakened by this! Instead let ¬¨‚Ä†it make us strong and plant seeds of love amounts our needy communities.. it is spring the time for cleaning and planting.. so let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s plant the seeds and watch them grow into something beautiful that hasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t been seen in a long time.!",

I found myself thinking about how scary it would be for my wife‚Äö√Ñ√¥s grandmother to get out and try to brave the stores with all the masses of people. With this in mind, I started a Facebook group with the notion that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d get around 10 people together to help deliver groceries to high risk senior citizens as well as immunocompromised individuals. One week later, the page has blown up to over 7,000 members and still growing. We have countless volunteers and a leadership team comprised of community members from all different backgrounds.  In a time that is so uncertain and can feel so dark, we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had one mission and one mission only: to spread hope through taking care of high-risk senior and immunocompromised individuals in our community. But the need has become so much bigger and clearer than we thought it would be.   These community members are lonely, they are afraid. They are unable to leave their homes and are running out of basic necessities like food, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, hygiene items and the list goes on. Many of them are unsure of where their next meal is going to come from after the food they have has run out. If each person in this group made a donation, whether it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a financial contribution or a donation of items, we can all be a catalyst for change right here in our community.  Please consider a financial contribution and be a part of serving those most vulnerable in our community in the midst of this pandemic.    Goodness is out there, you just have to tap into it.",

It would mean the world to me (and my mom) if you can find it in your heart to donate towards my fees. Any amount would help out and greatly be appreciated. I want to raise as much as I can so she doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have to worry about me since my brother membership is about the same. Please consider helping me out.

            "description": "This is an Urgent Appeal!   Hello, we are Tom, Annie,   Dandan, the Shelton family.  We're in a quarantined town in the Philippines amid the Coronavirus outbreak, and we're about to have a baby!   Annie is due to give birth on the 17th April 2020, just 29 days from the time I write this.  Our town of El Nido has been locked down due to COVID-19. All tourists have been told to leave and none can enter.    The quarantine has caused our fledgling holiday business to collapse.¬¨‚Ä† We now have no income, and no money to pay for the birth of our baby.   We are 6 hours away from the nearest functioning hospital in Puerto Princesa city.  Our scans show a baby boy, and he's going to be called David Antonio, after both of our fathers.  Thankfully, mother, baby, and our young son, all appear to be healthy, but the life of our baby is at stake.   We need money for:   Pre-natal ultrasound   consultation Midwife for birth Doctor for birth Post-natal baby scan Standby money, for medical emergency Two-way transport to hospital in Puerto Princesa city during lockdown¬¨‚Ä†  Rent for basic room near hospital  At least one weeks food (2 adults, 1 child, 1 baby)  Money to cover our rent for one month which will give us a chance to get back on our feet  The infant mortality rate in Philippines is over 5 times higher than in the UK.     Who are we?   Firstly, some background. Some of you may remember news about us in the  UK national press  , on BBC Radio and  TV News ¬¨‚Ä† (5:12am) in 2018, as well as an article I wrote  here ¬¨‚Ä†.¬¨‚Ä†   At the time, the UK‚Äö√Ñ√¥s notorious ‚Äö√Ñ√≤hostile environment‚Äö√Ñ√¥ had forced our temporary separation due to visa controls on non-EU family members, including Annie   Dandan.¬¨‚Ä†   During a devastating few years in the Philippines, we became the targets of a criminal gang, who's crimes against us included theft, kidnap, and two counts of attempted murder.¬¨‚Ä† After a police manhunt, the gang were arrested, and are now serving life-long prison sentences. But, we'd lost everything, our business, belongings, even our home, and any means to provide a stable future for our family.  We were truly broken.  The lowest point was collecting empty bottles in the streets, to return them to the stores for their deposit money, just a few pesos, to buy rice and fish to feed ourselves for another day. It was gut-wrenching, humiliating, and humbling. It broke our hearts.¬¨‚Ä† Our little boy, Dandan, showed tremendous strength of character through this. He was, and remains our inspiration and motivation, our own little superhero. He is very excited about becoming a big brother to baby David.  We determined never again to face such extremes of poverty, and not let this criminal gang destroy us. But now we have the COVID-19 lock-down to contend with, at a crucial moment in our lives!      The Present   Over the past year, with a lot of hard work, we managed to build a new business,  Banana Grove Backpackers Inn ¬¨‚Ä†.  Until the COVID-19 outbreak, it was a tremendous success. If you read our reviews, you can see that we've thrown our hearts and souls into this business, to build a stable future for our family, at long last. But under quarantine, our income has collapsed.  Until recently, our simple little place was full of happy guests .¬¨‚Ä† Our small income was ploughed back into the business in order to grow and provide long-term financial security. Our expected income was enough to pay for the safe delivery of our baby, his birth, care, and the care of Annie during this final month of pregnancy and beyond. Now that security is severely threatened by the lock-down which could last for months.  Our baby will not wait to be born in 'better times'.  We now urgently need to find money to pay for the most basic necessities; a midwife, medical fees, a pre-birth scan, travel expenses to and from the hospital, accommodation to be near the hospital, food, clothing, medical check-ups, rent, money to pay for electricity to run a fridge and a fan, and even money to pay for drinking water.  In short, we need to pay for every essential that our new baby, and our family will need until our business can start to thrive again.¬¨‚Ä† But we have no means to pay for any of it!  We live very frugal, simple lives. We have moved out of our house and into a bamboo hut at Banana Grove to save money.¬¨‚Ä† We don't have the 'luxuries' of modern living, no car, no TV, no air-con, no oven or microwave, no designer clothes, nor even hot water. We are focused on working hard to provide a safe and loving environment for each other, and a brighter future for our children.  This is urgent. Our family is in real trouble. This is for baby David Antonio Shelton, our beautiful unborn child, And so we appeal to your generous heart, your charitable nature, to your human kindness. Please give what you can to help us get through this incredibly difficult time. Please give what you can to give him a start in life. Without your help, and without the essential care that a newborn baby needs, he may not survive.   (Due to platform restrictions, all donations need to be made via my sister in the UK and then transferred to us in the Philippines).  Please give generously, and share this appeal. We will return what we can, when we can.   With the whole of my heart, thank you.‚Äö√Ñ¬Æ  Yours sincerely,‚Äö√Ñ¬Æ  Tom Shelton",

            "description": "Liebe Mitmenschen,  vielen Dank vorab f‚àö¬∫rs Lesen. Ich arbeite als freiberufliche Lehrerin (Englisch und Spanisch) auf Honorarbasis und habe nun seit Montag 16.03.20 leider keinen Job mehr, da das Institut, in dem ich unterrichtete, von der Senatsverwaltung f‚àö¬∫r Bildung Jugend und Familie aufgrund des Corona-Virus bis mindestens 19.04.20 geschlossen wurde. Da wir haupts‚àö¬ßchlich Sch‚àö¬∫ler und Sch‚àö¬∫lerinnen mit Berlin Pass (F‚àö‚àÇrderung durch den Staat) unterrichten und f‚àö¬∫r diese SuS auch ein Verbot f‚àö¬∫r Online Nachhilfe ausgesprochen wurde (da diese der Staat in der Pandemie Situation nicht mehr bezuschusst) bin ich seit dem 16.03.20 arbeitslos.  Da ich, trotz meines jungen Alters, durch den Verlust einer Niere von einigen Jahren und andere mir hierdurch entstandene chronische Krankheiten zur hohen Risikogruppe geh‚àö‚àÇre, befinde ich mich seit dem 14.03.20 in Quarant‚àö¬ßne zu Hause. Ich bem‚àö¬∫he mich, Online Nachhilfen zu finden, jedoch halten leider viele Eltern nicht viel von dieser Art des Unterrichtens. Aufgrund dessen hoffe ich von Herzen auf Hilfe/Unterst‚àö¬∫tzung, um wenigstens einen Monat lang erstmal meine dringlichsten Fixkosten (Lebensunterhalt) bezahlen zu k‚àö‚àÇnnen. Bei der Senatsverwaltung f‚àö¬∫r Finanzen wurde mein Antrag auf finanzielle Unterst‚àö¬∫tzung f‚àö¬∫r Freiberufler mit der Begr‚àö¬∫ndung abgelehnt, dass die Senatsverwaltung und nicht das Gesundheitsamt die Schlie‚àö√ºung veranlasst h‚àö¬ßtte...  Ich wei‚àö√º, ich bin definitiv nicht die einzige Person in solch einer Lage - trotz dessen habe ich mich dazu entschlossen, hier einen Versuch zu starten.  Ich danke allen - passt gut auf euch und eure Familien auf - bleibt gesund!",

            "description": "COVID-19 (as pictured above) has been described by many Epidemiologist and Virologists as the perfect blend of virus characteristics. It spreads effectively through numerous means of transmission during a lengthy incubation period and kills effectively (WHO current death rate prediction 3.4%) which is 340 times more than the flu (which has drug treatment options).  Harvard studies have shown that containment is not likely, and this virus is here to stay. ¬¨‚Ä†Models predict that by the end of the year 40-70% of the world population will become infected and thus killing over 100 million people. ¬¨‚Ä†Remember that this virus does not discriminate or care if you are a Billionaire, President or poor...it affects us all in the same way. ¬¨‚Ä†There is currently no drugs approved to treat COVID-19. ¬¨‚Ä†  Now is the time to step up and to not invest in toilet paper (as you are flushing away money that could actually make a difference). ¬¨‚Ä†Even world governments are not in my opinion spending money the correct way, which is not to focus almost entirely (dumping trillions of dollars) into the world economies to just slow down the inevitability that global markets will be drastically affected by this disease. ¬¨‚Ä†Instead, invest in stopping the disease by creating a vaccine or drugs to treat COVID-19, along with stabilizing the world economy. ¬¨‚Ä†As a Nurse, I will relate this stupidity to only giving blood to a person with a severed carotid artery...what is going to happen by just doing that?...uhh, you are still going to bleed out, it just will take a bit longer. ¬¨‚Ä†The smart thing to do would be not only give blood, but to repair the severed artery so the person stops bleeding.  I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t help but think about the over $1 Billion dollars that was donated within a day and a half after the Notre-Dame Cathedral‚Äö√Ñ√¥s fire in April of last year, but the world can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t come together and donate to save lives....hundred of millions of lives! ¬¨‚Ä†  This is the time for the world to come together, raise funds for a coordinated effort to create a vaccine and treatment options to combat COVID-19. ¬¨‚Ä†Together the world can achieve this goal in a timely, safe and effective way.  ALL proceeds will be donated to The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which was set up to fight emerging epidemics and is currently needing funds to create a vaccine. ¬¨‚Ä†They have invested $23.7 million so far and anything you can spare will help!  Stop thinking about wiping your butt and focus on saving it. ¬¨‚Ä†Donate today!",

            "description": "Wrestling fans of Nottingham may already know about House of Pain Wrestling, a company that puts on family-friendly shows all around the county, featuring some of the top local talent of the area, and entertaining hundreds of fans and families every month. House of Pain Wrestling recently celebrated its 10th Anniversary. What you may not know is that House of Pain Wrestling as it is today would not be possible without the House of Pain Wrestling Academy, a full time facility that currently supports over 100 people to achieve their dreams and train to be professional wrestlers, all from a former church hall in Radford. Everyone is welcome at HOP, from children to adults, the fit and the unfit, anyone with the desire to train in the thing we all love. The House of Pain Academy has never been run for profit. As the academy itself has grown, from once a week training on a Sunday, to the full time facility it is today, so the need for more funding to cover the overheads has grown. When we moved to the new facility, those overheads became higher. We started putting on more regular shows to generate the income to pay for the facility. Currently almost half of the business's income comes from the 5+ shows a month we run around Nottinghamshire. In these uncertain times, it would clearly be unsafe to run our regular monthly shows, which leaves the HOP academy in danger of financial difficulties. Without the HOP academy, there would be no HOP shows, but it would also leave people with no where to train, and would leave trainers and wrestlers out of work. We get no help from any other organisations, we're a very small not-for-profit business, and as such we have no contingency plan for global events such as these. We will be producing a series of \"\"no fans\"\" shows, filmed at the Academy by a group of volunteers from the academy, just for you, for the first time ever. If you enjoy our online shows, have enjoyed our shows live in the past, or you just want to help and would like to contribute, please do so, because we really need your help.",

Normally, you can find us performing for 2000 people about 3 to 4 times a week. However, due to the recent ban on large events in order to curb a further outbreak of the coronavirus, I, like many of you, am left sitting at home.¬¨‚Ä†   GOAL- POST PANDEMIC : Use the funds raised through this campaign to organize global \"\"thank you\"\" events and concerts around the world for as many healthcare and public service workers as possible. These concerts will be performed by local freelance artists who have been economically affected by this pandemic.  Being stuck at home bursting with creativity and not being able to create and perform forced us to think of possible ways to combine the current global situation with music, resulting in #musicdoesntstop campaign and this fundraiser.  Through this funding campaign, we musicians want to raise awareness to support the work of our incredible healthcare and public service workers who are at the frontlines of the corona pandemic. At the same time, many freelance artists and musicians are facing performance and project cancellations. Although this is inevitable and an effort for the greater good of society, this means that these artists are sitting at home without any income prospects for an unknown, and most likely, an extended period of time.   #musicdoesntstop  - We encourage all artists, musicians, music lovers and followers around the world to stand up for our fellow musicians, artists, healthcare and public service workers in this difficult and uncertain time. Share your videos playing your favorite music and voice support for the people working at the frontlines of the corona pandemic.¬¨‚Ä†Also, don't forget to mention the issue of freelance musicians and artists who are living through this difficult time, while their source of livelihood is on hold as their work is being canceled.¬¨‚Ä†  As musicians we live to perform for our audiences, giving them a moment to reflect, enjoy, share emotions, and find support in difficult times. Not being able to perform in the traditional concert halls, theaters, stages etc. does NOT mean that the music in us and the urge to share must stops.   Credibility : Depending on the amount we will raise, ¬¨‚Ä†we will collectively decide on¬¨‚Ä† the number and location of the concerts. Everyone who donates will have a vote in the decision making process. We will l foster partnerships with local concert agencies, International NGO's and musician/artists organizations to facilitate these concerts and provide live-streaming where possible. A team of credible experienced professionals from the music, health care industry, and business world will work side by side to develop a comprehensive proposal and¬¨‚Ä† detailed action plan outlining the steps forward to ensure that your donation touches as many people as possible.  Connect the world through music!  Use the hashtag #musicdoesntstop, mention the website and let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s get this cause trending!¬¨‚Ä†  Please go to¬¨‚Ä†www.musicdoesntstop.com¬¨‚Ä†for more info.

            "description": "Our dear sister Teresa, selfless and dedicated with a heart for others, succumbed on 3/30/17 to a rare form of cancer which affects only 1 in 5 million and is extremely aggressive.¬¨‚Ä† As with so many women who have suffered through the ravages of an abusive relationship, she was robbed of many of life‚Äö√Ñ√¥s pleasures except for those which her 3 children have brought her.¬¨‚Ä† Working through hardships unspeakable for most people, including several occasions of homelessness and as the only source of income for the past 25 years, her indomitable spirit to provide for her family, drove her to continue go to work under grueling physical discomfort up to 5 days before her passing while in hospice care.¬¨‚Ä† Typical of Teresa, the day before her death, continued to beg us to take her to work for she had to make sure that the company payroll was processed.¬¨‚Ä† Not unexpectedly, those who have had the privilege of knowing Teresa have wanted to visit with her and the stream of visitors was purely heartwarming and delighted Teresa with some coming from as far away as Hawaii.¬¨‚Ä† Unfortunately, the veracity of this illness left little time to prepare and plan for final arrangements.¬¨‚Ä† The family has decided that her remains will be returned to her native country the Philippines where the family has arranged for her to, at last rest, beside her mother in Cebu.¬¨‚Ä† Her two sons have stepped up to take charge of her affairs but are facing challenges as all the kids were living at home and as of this week will not have a home.¬¨‚Ä† It is important to note that her sons have inherited her drive and both are working several jobs and going to school.¬¨‚Ä† However, the cost of final arrangements and expenses of the transition exceed their capacity.¬¨‚Ä† It is the desire of the family to get the boys into a shared apt. and set up for a success; additionally, for them to accompany Teresa back to the Philippines on her final journey.¬¨‚Ä† Neither has been to their mothers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ native land.¬¨‚Ä† Anyone who has spent time with Teresa always left feeling uplifted.¬¨‚Ä† Now let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s get together and left up the rest of her family in her behalf!  Our goal is to raise enough money to help with the expenses of caring for her remains and prepare the kids for a life without their mother, best friend and provider.¬¨‚Ä† Additionally, if funds are available we would like to have them personally accompany her to her final resting place in the Philippines where her loving family is ready to receive her.  ¬¨‚Ä†Undray Jewel Jackson II, (Konkie to some), Teresa's oldest son is designated as the custodian of the funds raised in this campaign. ¬¨‚Ä†He has stepped up and is taking care of all the responsibilities. ¬¨‚Ä†  Life celebration service will be on April 28 and we will update everyone with the details later. ¬¨‚Ä†Again, thank ¬¨‚Ä†you all for your tremendous support!",
